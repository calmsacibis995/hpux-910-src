1). Update version.c
2). Correct makefile for standard release (don't forget to change INC and CDEF)
3). To build an rel1.0 or rel1.1 pre IC3 analyze you will need the pty.c.oldh
    file, as IND changed the names. This is out of the rcs files.
.
4) To build a release 2.0 version you might need to uncomment the SO_SOCKET
   _EVENT line, as it is not on the trunk I have only added it in as a comment.

5) Because of changes made to the vnode kernel we must temporaily copy
   all h files into the sys directory. This is because times.h changed
   and it gets included as h.times.h
