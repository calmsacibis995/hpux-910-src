The man page for analyze should be in the ADMIN section, unless we
have a special section for unreleased commands.


The man page is called analyze.man 


Layout of objects  directory.
				Contains make file and object files
Layout of manpage  directory.
				Contains often out of date man pages
				analyze.man
	
Layout of io       directory.
				Contains I/O files
Layout of debrec   directory.
				Contains debug record files
Layout of grammar  directory.
				Contains grammar rules
Layout of net      directory.
				Contains networking files
Layout of DOC      directory.
				Contains documentation
Layout of link     directory.
				Contains communication files 
				to allow analyze to talk over a
				parallel card link
Layout of somacces directory.
				Contains routines to access
				the s800 som, s300 is much easier
				no need for directory.
Layout of standard directory.
				Contains core stack trace, symbol trace,
				main driver routines (analyze/analyze1.c).
				Contains translation and memory
				read routines.
				Contains VM and process management routines
				Contains FS routines

Description of some files in standard and grammar directories.

gram.y	- grammar rules
lexsrc.l- parsing rules
version.c - version string

==========================

inc.h 	   - header files
an_nlist.h - nlist array
an_nldef.h - nlist defines
an_rpb.h   - rpb layout
symdef.h   - s300 symbol table stuff
unwind.h   - s800 symbol table stuff
defs.h     - normal defines
externs.h  - normal defines
types.h    - type declarations


==========================

analyze.c - main program
analyze1.c

==========================

get.c	- get data routines (getchunk)
log.c	- log routines (tuck data away)
scan.c	- scan data structures logging data, and scanning for resources
	  inconsistencies.

dump.c	- format data structures.

trace.c	- stack tracing code.

symbol.c- symbol resolution.

find.c  - verify indexes, and addresses

display.c- interactive interface to the main routines.

	      Guide lines to Reading Memory



	These read from logical memory, out to the end of BSS.

get     - Get a word from logical text, initialized data, or bss.
getshort  Really anything from the nlist structure (anything in the
	  nlist structure, as all entries from nlist come from the 
	  above category)

lseek   - Seek from logical memory file out to end of BSS only.
read    - Read from logical memory file out to end of BSS only.




	These read from physical memory, anywhere.

getreal - Get a word from the physical location (addresses obtained
	  from getphyaddr ot ltor).
getshortreal


longseek- Seek in physical memory file (addresses obtained from
	  getphyaddr, or ltor).
longread- Read from physical memory file.


	

	Translation routines

	You cannot use any of these until the mapping structures
	are set up. In the S800 that means until the pdir is
	read in. In the S300 it means once Sysmap has been read in.
	These both occur fairly early in analyze.c


ltor    - Convert long address to real (space, offset).
	  On the S300 its (0, offset) for kernel or (proc, offset)
	  for user space.
	- It has been suggested to make it (vas,offset) for regions.

getchunk- Get a chunk of vitual memory at the specified location and 
	  put in buf provided.

getphyaddr()
	- Getphyaddr just gets a physical address of a kernel address
	  (it just calls ltor with 0 for the space). People should probably
	  use ltor directly.

All the files starting with "net" are for the HP-UX networking
code.  Right now the networking code supports CIO and NIO Lan
drivers.  (Thanks to Randy Janke)

All the networking code is only UPWARD compatible.
I tried to make it backward compatible but it became a real pain
because people were changing header files right and left.
