Welcome to the series 300 kernel debugger!

kdb.man is the manual page for the kernel debugger. Use 'nroff -man' to
look at it

kdb.irs is the IRS for the kernel debugger. Use 'nroff -mm' to look at it.

CHANGES is a file I use to describe the major features of different releases.

Admin_new is a script I used to bump sccs levels

The rest is source or used to build the source

Makefile is the name of the makefile.

Read the manual entry first. Read the IRS second. Read the code last.
