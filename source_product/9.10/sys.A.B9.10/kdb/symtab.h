 *                      SYMBOLIC DEBUG FORMAT ACD
 *
 *
 *
 * ---- 1.  INTRODUCTION
 *
 *
 *      This document describes the current format for data tables which
 *      appear in HP-UX / HPE object files (a.out files).  These tables
 *      will be generated by the compilers, fixed up by the linker, and
 *      used by various programs (primarily the symbolic debugger(s)) to
 *      reconstruct information about the program.  The form of this
 *      document is a C include file annotated with comments.
 *
 *      On SPECTRUM, a major goal was that the linker need not know
 *      anything about the format.  To this end, it was decided that the
 *      debug information be composed of several unloadable subspaces
 *      within an unloadable space (named $DEBUG$), and that link time
 *      updates to the debug information be made through the standard
 *      mechanism of a list of fixups.  The linker will perform the
 *      required fixups for the debug spaces, and subspaces from
 *      separate compilation units will be concatenated.  However, at
 *      exec time, the loader would know that the debug space is not to
 *      be loaded.
 *
 *      Similarly, on the series 300, several debug tables are present
 *      in the a.out format which are not loaded at exec time.  Debug
 *      tables are simply concatenated into larger tables at link time
 *      and all fixups are then performed by pxdb.
 */

/*
 * ---- 2.  SUMMARY OF STRUCTURES
 *
 *
 *      The debug information consists of six tables:  a header table
 *      and five special tables.  The header table will contain one
 *      header record for each compilation unit.  Each header record
 *      identifies the size (in bytes) of the five tables generated by
 *      that compilation unit.  Two of the tables are very similar.  The
 *      GNTT and LNTT both contain name and type information (NTT for
 *      Name and Type Table).  The GNTT contains information about
 *      globals, and is thus limited to variables, types, and constants.
 *      The LNTT is for information about locals.  The LNTT must
 *      therefore contain scoping information such as procedure nesting,
 *      begin-end blocks, etc.  The GNTT and LNTT are both DNTTs (Debug
 *      Name and Type Tables), so the prefix DNTT is attached to objects
 *      (like a DNTTPOINTER) that are relevant to both the GNTT and
 *      LNTT.  The SLT contains information relating source (or listing)
 *      lines to code addresses.  The SLT and LNTT contain pointers
 *      between the two tables, so that the scoping information
 *      contained in the LNTT can also be used with the SLT.  The VT
 *      contains ascii strings (such as variable names) and the values
 *      of named constants.  The five tables are summarized below:
 *
 *  
 *      Table           Abbr  Contains                   Points into  
 *      =============   ====  =========================  ===============
 *      Global symbols  GNTT  global name-and-type info  GNTT
 *      Local symbols   LNTT  local name-and-type info   GNTT,LNTT,SLT,VT
 *      source line     SLT   source/listing line info   LNTT,SLT
 *      value           VT    names and constants        -
 *      xref            XT    File offsets and Attributes XT,VT
 *
 *
 *      The pointers needed within the debug tables are in fact indexes
 *      into the tables.  The GNTT, LNTT, and SLT each consist of a series
 *      of equal-sized entries.  Some DNTT entries begin a data structure
 *      and some are extension entries.  Some SLT entries are "special"
 *      (point back to the LNTT), others are "assist" (point forward in 
 *      the SLT), but most are "normal" (point to code).
 *
 *      There can be pointers from the LNTT to the GNTT, as it is common
 *      to have local variables of a global type.  However, there are
 *      never pointers from the GNTT to the LNTT, as global variables
 *      are never of a local type.
 *
 *      The tables are defined to be as machine-independent as possible,
 *      but the debugger may need to "know" some facts about the system 
 *      and language it is dealing with.
 *
 *      The GNTT and LNTT are the only tables that require fixups to be
 *      generated by the compiler and acted upon by the linker.  There
 *      are other fixups to be done, but these are all done by the pre-
 *      processor.

 *      The string  types are reserved  for cases where the language has
 *      an explicit string type separate from "array of char".  
 *	
 *	The ANSI/C wchar_t typedef defines a special base-type to
 *	the debugger.  The interpretation of wide-characters during

 *	
 *      T_FLABEL is used for CONSTs which are actually FORTRAN labels.
 *      The T_FLABEL is needed for the following:  in FORTRAN there is
 *      the ASSIGN statement (ASSIGN <label> TO <integer variable>),
 *      which places the address of the statement prefixed with the
 *      label <label> into the integer variable.  This integer variable
 *      can then be used as a label (e.g. GOTO <integer variable>).
 *      The user may wish to display the contents of the integer variable
 *      as a label.  The DNTT LABEL entry is not sufficient, as the label
 *      need not be on an executable statement (e.g. a FORMAT statement),
 *      and the DNTT LABEL can only be used with executable statements.
 *
 *      The  bitlength in a DNTT entry further  qualifies the  basetype.

/*
 *      One  SRCFILE is emitted  for the start of each  source  file, the
 *      start of each  included  file, and the return from each  included
 *      file.  Additional SRCFILE entries must also be output before each
 *      DNTT_FUNC entry.  This guarantees the debuggers know which file a
 *      function  came  from.  Specifically, the rules are as follows:
 * 
 *	Definitions:
 *	  Source block:  contiguous block of one or more lines of text in a
 *	      source-file,  bounded by beginning or end-of-file  or include
 *	      directives  (conceptually  identical to the "basic  block" in
 *	      optimizer  jargon).  No  distinction  is made between  blocks
 *	      that contain compilable code and those that don't.
 *
 *        Code  segment:  contiguous  LINEAR  block of DNTT (and associated
 *            SLT) entries that are generated from the same "source block".
 *	      "SLT_SRC" is used here to actually refer to an SLT_SPEC entry
 *	      of type SLT_SRCFILE.  Same goes for SLT_FUNC.
 *
 *	1. One DNTT_SRCFILE and SLT_SRC must be emitted at the head of each
 *	   code segment to facilitate reading backwards through the DNTT or
 *	   SLT  tables  from any  point in the  segment  to  determine  the
 *	   enclosing  source file.  If the  source-file  changes within the
 *	   body of a function/subprogram, a DNTT_SRCFILE/SLT_SRC  pair must
 *	   be emitted prior to any additional DNTT or SLT entries generated
 *	   by the remainder of that function/subprogram.
 *
 *      2. One DNTT_SRCFILE/SLT_SRC  pair is always emitted *immediately*
 *         before  any   DNTT_FUNC/SLT_FUNC.  Exception:  a  DNTT_SA  and
 *         associated  DNTT_XREF may appear  between a DNTT_FUNC and it's
 *         preceding  DNTT_SRCFILE.  There  can be  nothing  between  the
 *         SLT_SRC and the  SLT_FUNC.  The  DNTT_SRCFILE  (preceding  the
 *         DNTT_FUNC)  must  name  the  file   containing  the  functions
 *         declaration.  The SLT_FUNC must contain the line number of the
 *         line in the function's  declaration  where the function's name
 *         appears.  This line  number  must match the line  number  that
 *         appears in the XT record denoting the function's  declaration.
 *         The SLT_END associated with the SLT_FUNC must contain the line
 *         number of the source line containing the  scope-closing  token
 *         (i.e.  "}" or "end").
 *
 *	3. One DNTT_SRCFILE/SLT_SRC  pair must be emitted for a source file
 *	   that  otherwise  would not be mentioned in the DNTT i.e.  source
 *	   files that do not generate a code segment.  This is required for
 *	   Static analysis only.
 *
 *
 *      "address"  points to a special  SLT  entry  (for the line  number
 *      only), but the code location is known from context in the SLT.  *
 *
 *      NOTE: Listing files and listing file line numbers may be used in
 *            place of source files and source file line numbers.  A
 *            special compiler option will designate which is generated
 *            by the compiler.
 *
 *      SRCFILE names are exactly as seen by the  compiler,  i.e.  they
 *      may be relative,  absolute, or whatever.  C include  file names
 *      must be given as absolute  paths if found "in the usual  place",
 *      i.e., /usr/include/...

/*
 *      Struct  DNTT_FUNC is used for dfunc and dentry, and dblockdata  types.
 *      One FUNCTION  or  ENTRY  is  emitted   for  each   formal   function
 *      declaration   (with  a   body)   or   secondary   entry   point,
 *      respectively.  They are not emitted  for  bodyless  declarations
 *      (FORWARD, EXTERNAL, "int x ();" etc.).  A dblockdata is emitted for
 *      Fortran BLOCK DATA constructs only.
 *
 *      "address" always points to a special SLT entry.
 *
 *      For FUNCTION types, the "entryaddr" field is the code address of
 *      the primary entry point of the function.  The "lowaddr" field is
 *      the lowest code address of the function.  The "hiaddr" field
 *      is the highest code address of the function.  This both gives
 *      the size of the  function  and helps in mapping code locations 
 *      to functions when there are anonymous (non-debuggable) functions
 *      present.  These three fields should be filled in by the generation
 *      of fixups.
 *
 *      For ENTRY types, the "entryaddr" field points to the proper code
 *      location for calling the function at the  secondary  entrypoint,
 *      and the "lowaddr" and "hiaddr" fields are nil (zero).  For a
 *      FORTRAN subroutine with alternate entries, DNTT_DVARs are required
 *      to represent the parameters, see the DNTT_FPARAM definition for
 *      the details.
 *
 *      For BLOCKDATA types, the "public" bit should be set to 1, the
 *      "level", "optimize", "varargs" and "info" fields should all be 0.
 *      The "firstparam" field should be DNTTNIL.  The "entryaddr" and
 *      "lowaddr" fields should be 0, and the "highaddr" field should be
 *      FFFFFFFC (-4).  The "retval" field should be set to T_UNDEFINED,
 *      with length 0.  An SLT_FUNCTION/SNT_END pair should be emitted
 *      for each DNTT_FUNC (BLOCKDATA).
 *
 *      Every FUNCTION or BLOCKDATA must have a matching END (see below).
 *
 *      For languages in which a functions return value is set by assigning
 *      the value to the function name (such as FORTRAN & Pascal), a DVAR
 *      entry should also be emitted for the function.  The address of this
 *      DVAR for the function should be the address of the answer spot for
 *      the function.  This will allow the user to display the current 
 *      return value while the function is executing.
 *
 *	The "varargs" field indicates whether the function was declared as
 *	having a variable-length parameter list.  This is currently possible
 *	only via ANSI/C function-prototype "ellipses" (...).  The "info" field
 *	provides additional language-specific characteristics of the function
 *	and/or its parameter-list.
 *
 *      The FUNCTION DNTT should be used only in the LNTT.

  *      FPARAMs are chained  together in  parameter  list order (left to

  *      for  each  parameter,  whether  or not the  type  is  explicitly
  *      declared.  For unnamed parameters, the FPARAM name is "*".
  *
  *      "regparam"  implies  that the  storage  location  given is to be
  *      interpreted  as a REGTYPE, not a DYNTYPE, that is, the parameter
  *      was passed in a register.
  *
  *      "indirect"  implies that the storage  location given  contains a
  *      data  pointer  to the  parameter  described,  not the  parameter
  *      itself, due to a call by reference  (Pascal VAR, for  instance).
  *      In the case  where a  call-by-value  parameter  is too big to be
  *      passed in the parameter list (e.g., a copied-value  parameter in
  *      Pascal), the "location" must be given as the actual  (post-copy)
  *      location of the parameter.
  *
  *      "longaddr" is meaningful only for varparams, and indicates that
  *      the storage location given contains a 64 bit Spectrum long
  *      pointer.  The long pointer could be in 2 consecutive words, or
  *      in the case of a regparam, two consecutive registers.
  *
  *      "copyparam" implies that the parameter has been copied to a local,
  *      and thus the location is relative to the sp of the current procedure,
  *      not the sp of the previous procdeure.
  *
  *      "misc" is for assorted values. Current uses are:
  *           (1) if the parameter is of type T_FTN_STRING_S300
  *               then the "misc" field contains the SP relative
  *               offset of the word containing the length of 
  *               the string
  *
  *      In the case of a FORTRAN routine with alternate entries, DNTT
  *      DVARs also must be emited for each parameter. The reason is
  *      that with FORTRAN alternate entries, the same parameter can
  *      be in two different entry's parameter lists, in a different 
  *      location (ex. the parameter "x" in "subroutine a(x,y,z)" and
  *      "entry b(v,w,x)") and yet they both represent the same parameter.
  *      Thus in order to insure a consistant address for such parameters,
  *      the compiler allocates a local temporary, and the prologue code
  *      for each entry copies the parameters into the local temps. So, to
  *      insure that the debugger can find the parameters, a DNTT DVAR
  *      must be generated for each temporary, with the name of the DVAR
  *      being the name of the FPARAM for which the temp. was allocated.
  *
  *      The FPARAM DNTT should be used only in the LNTT.

 *      SVARs describe  static  variables  (with respect to storage, not

 *      word, "offset", not needed for the other  types.  This  provides
 *      for direct data which is indexed from a base, and indirect  data
 *      which is accessed through a pointer, then indexed.  
 
 *      The "location" field of an SVAR will require a fixup.  An
 *      example of when the offset field can be useful, is a FORTRAN
 *      common block.  In a common block declaration such as "common
 *      /marx/ groucho, harpo, chico", the symbol "marx" is the only
 *      global symbol.  If "marx" is accessed indirectly, then the
 *      address of "harpo" would contain the address of "marx" in the
 *      location field (with the indirect bit on), and the offset of
 *      "harpo" from "marx" in the offset field.  If "marx" is not
 *      indirect, then location field can be filled in by a fixup of the
 *      form address(marx) + offset of harpo, and the offset field is
 *      not needed.
 *
 *      The  compilers  must emit SVARs even for data objects the linker
 *      does not know about by name, such as variables in common blocks.
 *
 *      As in the FPARAM entry, the longaddr field indicates the use
 *      of a Spectrum long pointer, and is valid only if the indirect
 *      flag is true.  The "regvar" field also has the same meaning as in
 *      the FPARAM case.
 *
 *      For languages in which a functions return value is set by assigning
 *      the value to the function name (such as FORTRAN & Pascal), a DVAR
 *      entry should also be emitted for the function.  The address of this
 *      DVAR for the function should be the address of the answer spot for
 *      the function.  This will allow the user to display the current 
 *      return value while the function is executing.
 *
 *      For a FORTRAN subroutine with alternate entries, DNTT_DVARs are 
 *      required to represent the parameters, see the DNTT_FPARAM 
 *      definition for the details.
 *
 *      The SVAR can be used in both the GNTT and LNTT, while the DVAR
 *      is only applicable to the LNTT.

 *      The DNTT_TYPE  type is used for dtype and dtag entries.  TYPEDEFs
 *      are  just  a way  of  remembering  names  associated  with  types
 *      declared in Pascal, via "type" sections, or in C, via "typedef"s.
 *      TAGDEFs are used for C "struct",  "union", and "enum" tags, which
 *      may be  named  identically  to  "typedef"s  in  the  same  scope.
 *      TAGDEFs  always  point at STRUCTs,  UNIONs, or ENUMs (see below),
 *      and provide a way to "hang" a name onto a subtree.
 *      
 *      Note  that  named  types  point   directly   to  the   underlying
 *      structures,   not  to  intervening   TYPEDEFs  or  TAGDEFs.  Type
 *      information in TYPEDEFs and TAGDEFs point to the same  structures
 *      independent of named instantiations of the types.
 *      
 *      For example:
 *      				+
 *      	typedef struct S {	+	typedef enum E { ... } EEE;
 *      		...		+
 *      	} *pS;			+
 *      
 *      would generate something like this (shown graphically)
 *      
 *      	TYPEDEF	"pS"		+	TYPEDEF "EEE"
 *      	  |			+	  |
 *      	POINTER			+	TAG	"E"
 *      	  |			+	  |
 *      	TAG	"S"		+	ENUM
 *      	  |			+	  |
 *      	STRUCT			+	  :
 *      	  |			+	  :
 *      	  :			+
 *      	  :			+
 *      
 *      Note also that variables (of a named non-base type) must point to
 *      TYPEDEF or TAGDEF  dntt, and not the  underlying  structures.  If
 *      this is not done, the removal of duplicate global  information is
 *      impossible.
 *      
 *      The "typeinfo" flag only applies to TAGDEFs.  When not set, it is
 *      used to indicate  that an  underlying  struct,  union, or enum is
 *      named,  but  the  actual  type  is  not   declared.  In  general,
 *      "typeinfo"  will be set to 1.  It will be set to a 0 if the  type
 *      subtree is not available.  Consider the C file:
 *      
 *		typedef struct s *Sptr;
 *		main(){}
 *      
 *      which is a valid  compilation  unit with  "struct s"  defined  in
 *      another file.  For this case, the  "typeinfo" for TAGDEF "s" will
 *      be set to 0, and "type"  points to a "nil"  DNTT_STRUCT  (i.e.  a
 *      DNTT_STRUCT  entry  with  its  "firstfield",  "vartagfield",  and
 *      "varlist"  fields  set  to  DNTTNIL  and  its  "declaration"  and
 *      "bitlength"  fields set to 0).  Graphically:
 *
 *		TYPEDEF	"Sptr"
 *		  |
 *		POINTER
 *		  |
 *		TAG	"s"
 *		  |
 *		STRUCT
 *		   \---<firstfield>---> DNTTNIL
 *		    \--<vartagfield>--> DNTTNIL
 *		     \-<varlist>------> DNTTNIL
 *		      \- other fields > all set to 0
 *
 *
 *      Thus,  whenever   "typeinfo"  is  0,  "type"  must  point  to  an
 *      appropriate DNTT entry which has all its fields correctly NIL'ed.
 *      This  applies  to  *named*   DNTT_STRUCT's,   DNTT_UNION's,   and
 *      DNTT_ENUM's.
 *      
 *      The  TYPEDEF  and  TAGDEF  DNTTs may be used in both the GNTT and

/*
 *      The  dyn_low  and  dyn_high  fields  are  non-zero  only  if  the
 *      DNTT_SUBRANGE  is defining the range of an array index, otherwise
 *      they  are  always  zero.  The  dyn_low  and  dyn_high   bits  are
 *      duplicated in the  DNTT_SUBRANGE  defining the range of the array
 *      index  (so  sllic  can fix  the  pointers).  "dyn_low"  indicates
 *      whether  the  lower  bound  for the  subscript  of the  array  is
 *      dynamic.  If the dyn_low  field is zero, then the lowbound  field
 *      of the DNTT_SUBRANGE  entry, pointed to by the indextype field in
 *      the  DNTT_ARRAY  entry, is interpreted as a constant lower bound.
 *      If the dyn_low  field is 1, then the  lowbound  field of the DNTT
 *      SUBRANGE is interpreted as a DYNTYPE giving a local address where
 *      the lower  bound can be found.  If the  dyn_low  field is 2, then
 *      the  lowbound  field of the  DNTT_SUBRANGE  is  interpreted  as a
 *      DNTTPOINTER to a variable  whose value is the lower bound (needed
 *      if the lower bound is a static variable).  The dyn_low value of 3
 *      is not used.  The "dyn_high" bit has a similar  meaning  relating
 *      to the upper bound.  If an upper bound for an array  parameter is
 *      not given (like  assumed  size arrays in FORTRAN, or "char foo[]"
 *      in C) then the upper  bound in the  DNTT_SUBRANGE  should  be the
 *      largest  integer  that fits in a long  integer, so that any value
 *      the user can give is legal.
 *
 *      "arrayisbytes"  indicates that the field  "arraylength"  contains
 *      the length in bytes rather then bits.  This is needed on Spectrum
 *      where an array  could be up to 2**32  bytes.  A value of zero for
 *      bitsize will be used to represent 2**32.
 *
 *      "elemisbytes"  indicates that the field "elemlength" contains the
 *      elem.  length in bytes rather then bits.  The "elemlength"  field
 *      contains  the not the "true"  size of an array  element,  but the
 *      size  allocated to each element within the array (the "true" size
 *      plus any wasted  bits on the left or right).  As an example for a
 *      Pascal array of a 13 bit  structure, the array element size might
 *      equal 16, with the  justified  field  equal to 0 to indicate  the
 *      structure is left justified  within the 16 bits.  The "true" size
 *      of the  structure  would  be  found  in  the  size  field  of the
 *      DNTT_STRUCT pointed to by the "elemtype" field of the DNTT_ARRAY.
 *
 *      "indextype"   typically   points  to  a  SUBRANGE   for   bounds.
 *      "elemtype"  may  point to  another  ARRAY  for  multi-dimensional
 *      arrays.  Row or column precedence in the language is reflected in
 *      the order of the ARRAY  entries  on the chain.  For  example,  in
 *      Pascal, which is  row-precedent,  an array declared  [1..2, 3..4,
 *      5..6] would  result in "array 1..2 of array 3..4 of array 5..6 of
 *      ...".   The   same    declaration    in    FORTRAN,    which   is
 *      column-precedent,  would  result in "array  5..6 of array 3..4 of
 *      array 1..2 of ...".  This makes index-to-address  conversion much
 *      easier.  Either  way  an   expression   handler   must  know  the
 *      precedence for the language.
 *
 *      The SET,  SUBRANGE,  and ARRAY DNTTs can be used in both the GNTT
 *      and LNTT.

/*
 *      This table  consists  of a series of  entries,  each of which is
 *      either normal, special, or assist according to the sltdesc field 
 *      of the first word.  Normal entries contain an address (actually
 *      a code offset relative to the beginning of the current function) 
 *      and a source/listing line (by line number).  Listing line numbers
 *      may be used in place of source line numbers based upon a compiler
 *      option.  This will also be reflected in the DNTT_SRCFLE entries.
 *      Special  entries  also provide a line number (where something was 
 *      declared) and point back to the DNTT which references them.  This
 *      is used for quick determination of scope, including source/listing
 *      file, after an interrupt.  Even if there are multiple source/listing
 *      files, all source/listing line information is accumulated in this 
 *      one table.
 *
 *      The SLT was originally designed to be unnested, even for those
 *      languages whose LNTT must reflect their nesting.  The debuggers
 *      depend upon this.  For those languages that are nested the SLT
 *      must now be nested and an SLT_ASST must immediately follow each 
 *      SLT_SPEC of type FUNC.  The "address" field will be filled in by 
 *      the compiler back-ends to point forward to the first SLT_NORM in 
 *      the FUNC's scope.  The "firstnorm" is set to one if this SLT_NORM 
 *      is the first SLT_NORM looking sequentially forward in the SLT.
 *   
 *      The one exception to the normal/special/assist rule is the EXIT SLT.  
 *      The EXIT SLT is used to identify exit points for a routine.  The
 *      EXIT SLT is a special only in the sense that the sltdesc field
 *      is not equal to SLT_NORMAL.  However, it contains a line number 
 *      and address like a normal SLT.  The EXIT SLT is used in place of
 *      a NORMAL SLT for all exit statements (such as "return" in C and
 *      FORTRAN, or the "end" of a procedure body in Pascal).
 *
 *      The SLT_MARKER is for use in "Chunk-Per-Som". The address field
 *      contains a new base address (replacing the current procedure's
 *      low-address field.  This new base address will be added to succeding
 *      SLT_NORMALs and SLT_EXITs to produce an absolute address.
 *
 *      To distinguish prologue (function setup) code emitted at the END
 *      of a function from the last line (normal SLT) of the function, a
 *      normal  SLT entry with a line number of  SLT_LN_PRLOGUE is used.
 *      Such SLT entries are only emitted if there is trailing  prologue
 *      code, and they are always the last SLT emitted for the  function
 *      except for the special SLT entry for the function END.  For com-
 *      pilers that emit the prologue code before the main body, no 
 *      special prologue SLT entry is required.
 *
 *      One SLT entry is emitted  for (the FIRST  physical line of) each
 *      executable  statement, for each  construct that generates a DNTT
 *      entry which  points to an SLT entry, and for the prologue  code,
 *      if any.  The user cannot set a breakpoint without a corresponding
 *      SLT entry.  Compilers  must emit  multiple SLT  entries for parts
 *      of a composite statement (such as FOR) and for multiple statements
 *      appearing on one source line.
 *
 *      For compatibility, the high bits of DNTTPOINTERs  in SLT entries
 *      are also set to 1, even though they are not needed here.
 *
 *      The global bit on DNTTPOINTERs in SLT entries should always be 0,
 *      as the LNTT contains all the scoping information.

 *      each list  associated  with a DNTT object via the DNTT_XREF  that
 *      follows the object.  The DNTT_XREF  contains an XREFPOINTER which
 *      is an offset into the XT table, and denotes the  beginning of the
 *      reference list.
 *      
 *      Each list is  actually  one or more of linear  sub-list  that are
 *      linked  together.  Each  sublist  begins with an XREFNAME  entry,
 *      which names a (current)  source file.  Following  the XREFNAME is
 *      one or more  XREFINFO  entries,  one for each  appearance  of the
 *      object's name in the current  file.  These entries list what type
 *      of reference  and the line no.  within the file.  Column  numbers
 *      are currently  unsupported.  The XREFINFO1  structure is normally
 *      used.  The XREFINFO2A/B structure pair is only used for compilers
 *      which  support  line  numbers  greater  than  16  bits  long.  An
 *      XREFLINK marks the end of a sublist, so a typical  sequence looks
 *      like:
 *
 *		XREFNAME, XREFINFO1, XREFINFO1, ... , XREFLINK
 *
 *      Note that all  elements  of a sublist  must  appear  in  sequence
 *      (linearly).  If the list must be continued,  the XREFLINK  serves
 *      as a  continuation  pointer  from one  sublist  to the  next, and
 *      contains  another  offset  into the XT where the next  sublist is
 *      found  for the same  named  object.  If  there  is no  additional
 *      sublist, the XREFLINK contains a 0 index, denoting the end of the
 *      current list.
 *      
 *      Lists  for  the  same  named   object  may  appear  in  different
 *      compilation  units.  It is the  responsibility  of  PXDB  to link
 *      these together.

/*
 * ---- 9.  ORDERING OF TABLE ENTRIES
 *
 *
 *      LNTT and SLT  entries  must be emitted  and kept in source  file
 *      order wherever  possible.  As a minimum, named LNTT entries must
 *      be  emitted  and kept  within  the  proper  scope,  though  some
 *      compilers  may emit  them at the end of a scope  instead  of the
 *      beginning.  In  general,  the  debugger  must know the  emission
 *      rules for the  language it is dealing  with, and search the LNTT
 *      accordingly,  or else  always  search in both  directions.  
 *
 *      Items in the GNTT are all global, so the  public bit must always
 *      be set.  Within the LNTT, the public bit indicates that the item
 *      is exported  by the module in which  it resides, and  is visible
 *      within a module  or procedure that imports the containing module.
 *
 *      Compilers and linkers are encouraged to make multiple references
 *      to DNTT, SLT, and VT entries (even chains of DNTT entries) where
 *      possible  to reduce  redundancy  with no loss of data.  They are
 *      also  encouraged to emit entries grouped so that related entries
 *      are physically close, as long as no scope rules are violated.
 *
 *      SLT entries  must be emitted in sorted line number order  within
 *      each  file,  except  for  special  SLT  entries  for  ENTRYs and
 *      FUNCTIONs  only.  They may be out of line  number  order (due to
 *      nested  functions, etc.) so long as the next normal SLT entry is
 *      the proper place to breakpoint  the entity.  For example,  there
 *      can be numerous  ENTRY types after a FUNCTION, all  referring to
 *      the same code  location.  (If  there are no normal  SLT  entries
 *      before the next FUNCTION or MODULE entry and a SLT_ASST does not
 *      immediately  follow the  SLT_SPEC for a FUNC, the  entity has no
 *      breakpointable locations.)
 *
 *      SLT  entries  must be sorted in  ascending  code  address  order
 *      WITHIN  EACH  MODULE  or  FUNCTION  body.  It is  impossible  to
 *      require  that they be sorted  both by file line  number and code
 *      address  because  function  object code may be emitted or linked
 *      out of source order in a segment.
 *
 *      It is reasonable  to expect  sequential SLT entries may have the
 *      same line numbers or code locations (but not both, as that would 
 *      be  redundant).  This might be due to multiple statements on one
 *      source line or several scope levels starting at one place in the
 *      code.
 *
 *      Thus, for  nested languages  like  Pascal and  Modcal, the  LNTT 
 *      entries must  be nested to reflect the program's scope.  The SLT
 *      entries should also be  nested with an SLT_ASST  entry following
 *      each SLT_SPEC of type FUNC.
 */


/*
 * ---- 10.  LINKER CONSIDERATIONS
 *
 *      As stated earlier, all fixups to the debug information are
 *      done through the generation of a list of fixups for the GNTT
 *      and LNTT subspaces within the debug space.  Other than these 
 *      fixups, the only other task for the linker is the concatenation
 *      of the debug spaces from separate compilation units.
 */


/*
 * --- 11.  PREPROCESSOR

/*
 *     The preprocessor (PXDB) which must be run on the debug info in
 *     the executable program file massages this debug info so that the
 *     debugger may start up and run more efficiently.  Some of the
 *     tasks performed by PXDB are: remove duplicate global type and
 *     variable information from the GNTT, append the GNTT onto the end
 *     of the LNTT and place both back in the LNTT section, build quick
 *     look-up tables for files, procedures, modules, and paragraphs
 *     (for Cobol), placing these in the GNTT section, and reconstruct
