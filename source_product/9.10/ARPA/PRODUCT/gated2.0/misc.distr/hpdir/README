The files in the subdirectories of this directory are those that are
distributed with the GateD 2.1 distribution from Cornell. They are included
here for your use and reference.

The aux/ subdirectory includes scripts for managing gated.
These scripts are exactly like those found with the distribution from Cornell
and thus are unusable without modification.

The conf/ subdirectory includes various /etc/gated.conf files as found
at some major NSFnet hubs.  Do not use any of them as they appear
because they were designed to be used on specific machines in specific
configurations.
