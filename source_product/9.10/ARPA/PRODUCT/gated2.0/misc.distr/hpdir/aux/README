	These are just very primitive scripts to rotate the
	gated log files (much like syslog), do some primitive
	analysis of the logs, and mail the output to a list of
	users.

	Remember I said primitive and occasionally the awk scripts
	produce some strange results.

	gated-mon -  this is what you put in crontab. I run it every
		     day at midnight.

	gw-mon -  runs all the analysis scripts.

	rotatelogs - rotates the gated log files

	redirects.awk - awk script that provides a redirect summary

	changes.awk -  awk script that provides list of changes and deletions
