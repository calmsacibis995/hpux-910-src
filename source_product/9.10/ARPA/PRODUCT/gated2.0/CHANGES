		Gated changes by version number

Following are the changes between 2.1 and 2.0.1.18

	1.  The subsumtion of host routes in RIP updates was not done
	    according to the RIP spec.  Changed RIP and HELLO to do
	    this properly.  Note that a host route will be subsumed
	    even if the network that subsumes it is not being
	    announced.  This also allowed the rth_parent field to be
	    removed, with large routing tables this could cause alot
	    of overhead when adding routes.

	2.  It was possible to override the metric on when propagating
	    distance vector (routes) out the same protocol.

	3.  The code that daemonizes (detaches gated from the
	    terminal) was rewritten to conform to the suggestions in
	    "Unix Network Programing" by W. Richard Stevens.  This
	    should prevent the "wait3: no children" messages when
	    gated is started by /etc/rc.
	    
	4.  Specifying trace flags on the command line and also in the
	    configuration file resulted in tracing being turned off
	    all together.

	5.  After a reconfiguration, redirects were not reset to off,
	    even if RIP or HELLO were turned on.  The same applied to
	    the logic which determined if interfaces should be timed
	    out.

	6.  The SNMP interface did not properly clean up during
	    reconfiguration which resulted in a socket being orphaned
	    at each reconfiguration.


Following are the changes between 2.0.1.18 and 2.0.1.14

	1.  Provide definition for IP_MAXPACKET if not defined by
	    system. 

	2.  Correct some errors in the man pages

	3.  Add support for EGP parameter "propagatedefault" allowing
	    the default network (0.0.0.0) to be propagated to an EGP
	    neighbor.

	4.  Removed an autoincrement inside a routine call that is
	    implemented as a macro on some systems.

	5.  Use the metric to choose the perfered route if the protocol
	    and AS are the same.

	6.  Internally generated default (when EGP and BGP neighbors are
	    up) would be removed when the first neighbor went away.  It
	    would also not work properly through reconfiguration,
	    especially if default generation were enabled/disabled.

	7.  Remove duplicate calculation in timer_dispatch().

	8.  Specification of "traceoptions none" will turn off
	    tracing.

	9.  Many values were not reset to their defaults before
	    initiation of a reconfiguration.  Including policy lists
	    which specified gateways.

	10. EGP preference and BGP default metric and preference were
	    missing from the status dump file.

	11. N_interfaces was used to calculate interface policy lists
	    when a new variable, int_index_max was needed.

	12. Merge SYSV mods from Igor E. Chechik.  Some of these may
	    be ISC specific.

	13. Fix option processing so switches can follow -t.  Trace
	    flags must immediately follow the option with no
	    intervening white space.

	14. Interval times were being printed incorrectly to the East of
	    GMT.  Use a seperate format for printing intervals than for
	    printing times.

	15. Added code to check validity of metrics in propagate lists.

	16. The %directory directive no longer changes the current
	    directory, it now just provides a prefix for %include.

	17. Updated copyright

	18. The trusted gateways clause in the redirect group was
	    being ignored.

	19. The keyword "none" on the "traceoptions" clause was not
	    handled correctly.

	20. Too many nested includes would cause a core dump.

	21. It was not possible to leave off all the options on an EGP
	    group statement.

	22. Gated whould never notice when a trace dump was done and
	    remove the task.

	23. Finally applied patches for BSD 4.3 Reno.

	24. Forgot to close the routing table when receiving a bad
	    HELLO checksum.

	25. Block signals during reconfiguration.

	26. Ask kernel to reserve 16k buffers for receiving HELLO
	    packets.

	27. Forgot to reallocate packet buffer after reconfiguration.

	28. HP/UX specific changes

	29. Changes to compile on Ultrix 4.1.

	
Following are the changes between 2.0.1.14 and 2.0.1.10:

	1.  Clarify documentation of the order of propagate and
	    acceptance lists.

	2.  If route is not listed in /etc/services, gated assigned
	    the RIP port in reverse byte order.

	3.  Systems that do not have underscores in front of nlist
	    names would dereference a null pointer.

	4.  Fixed defines for IBM RS/6000 when compiler is in BSD mode.

	5.  Trustedgateways clauses were not working properly, needed to
	    propagate protocol flag into policy lists.

	6.  Add support for "acceptdefault" parameter for EGP neighbors
	    which allows the default network (0.0.0.0) to be accepted
	    from an EGP neighbor.

	7.  Add support for EGP parameter "packetsize" which allows the
	    EGP maximum packet size to be increased at runtime.

	8.  Updated copyright notice.


These are the changes between 2.0.1.8 and 2.0.1.10

	1.  Dump was not printing the pid of the main gated process,
	    instead it was printing the pid of the child spawned to
	    create the dump file.

	2.  Add warning that BSD 4.3 Reno is NOT supported by this
	    version of gated.

	3.  Fix core dump caused by allocating one byte too few when
	    reading kernel version.

	4.  Fix core dump when BGP session is closed remotely and BGP
	    tries to set the linger parameter.

	5.  Reduce the requested size of RIP/BGP/SNMP kernel buffers
	    from 48k to 32k.

	6.  Added error checking to fork().

	7.  Fixed compilation error in icmp.c on BSD 4.2 based system
	    that do not include the IP header in received ICMP
	    messages. 

	8.  Removed mystery semicolons in snmp.c.

	9.  Added man page submitted by Guy Middleton the University
	    of Waterloo.

	10. Fixed bugs in EGP poll/repoll code brought to light by
	    recent changes in MILNET polling intervals.

	11. Fix core dump at startup when using flex as a parser
	    generator.

	12. Timer bug doubled interval time.

	13. Fix bug reading kernel routes at startup on AIX 3.1 on an
	    RS/6000.
	
These are the changes between 2.0.1.4 and 2.0.1.8

	1.  Improved checking for duplicate interfaces.  Especially
	    don't look at the IP address of interfaces that are down.
	    
	2.  A symbolic link to asm.sed was missing from the compat
	    directory. 

	3.  A variable was missing from an error message in egp.c.

	4.  Add support for MIB-II ipRouteMetric5.

	5.  BGP and EGP did not locate their policy after a
	    reconfiguration causing it to revert to the default.

	6.  The source interface was not set properly for RIP and
	    HELLO broadcasts, resulting in incorrect error messages
	    from HELLO.
	    
	7.  The HELLO header was scrambled after calculating the HELLO
	    checksum.

	8.  Duplicate interfaces are not treated as a fatal error,
	    just produce error messages in the syslog.

	9.  Allow specification of EGP parameters P1 and P2 on a per
	    neighbor basis.


These are the changes between 2.0.1.2 and 2.0.1.4

	1.  Missing ioctl() in if_check() would cause gated to exit if
	    the status of a pointopoint interface changed.

	2.  On a non-broadcast, multi-acess (NBMA) network, such as
	    X.25, only apply split horizon to the source gateway.

	3.  BGP was not properly maintaining AS path reference counts,
	    causing various errors.
	
	4.  BGP was incorrectly setting the AS path for an EGP route
	    to the same as an AS path for an Interior route.  BGP was
	    also passing interior routes on to Internal peers.

	5.  Finish adding support for IBM AIX 3.1 on the RS/6000.

	6.  RIP preference specified in the config file was not being
	    honored.

	7.  The EGP preference flag had the same value as another flag
	    causing preference not to be honored.

	8.  EGP incorrectly calculated the number of active peers in
	    the same AS causing it to think that all peers were lost
	    when only one was.

	9.  Save the ID of the last EGP HELLO sent in case the I-H-U
	    response is slow and S gets incremented.

	10. Response to initial EGP Poll on transition to UP state was
	    not being honored because it not being flagged as sent and
	    the received update was considered unsolicited.

	11. Save the version number of the last EGP poll received to
	    improve check for repolls.

	12. EGP Polls in down state should be ignored instead of
	    causing a fatal error.

	13. EGP Acquisition messages other than Request and Confirm
	    should not have Hello and Poll intervals, but many
	    implementations do.  Allow for this extra length.

	
These are the changes between 2.0 and 2.0.1.2

	1.  Static Interface routes were added with RTF_GATEWAY flag.

	2.  Parsing of 'accept proto [rip|hello] gateway
	    <gateway_list>' was not handled properly.

	3.  Check for active routing protocols on an interface was
	    done improperly when deciding to make an interface
	    passive.

	4.  EGP was not allocating memory properly when building a
	    sorted list of gateways and networks.

	5.  When accessing an AS path, the wrong pointer was used.

	6.  Our AS was prepended to an AS path in host byte order
	    instead of network byte order.

	7.  AS path directions were stored in outgoing BGP packet as
	    shorts instead of chars.

	8.  RIP and HELLO added the interface metric instead of a hop
	    count to outgoing network.

	9.  Internally generated default was not announced because it
	    points to the loopback network.  Test for existance was
	    reversed, causing core dump.

	10. BGP was not setting SO_REUSEADDR delaying a restart of
	    gated.

	11. Work around compiler problem with High C on IBM/4.3.

	12. BGP was comparing sockaddr_in when port number was
	    supposed to be different.

	13. String lowercase function was improperly checking length
	    of internal buffer, causing a core dump when accessing off
	    the end of the buffer.

	14. Netmask on a P2P link should refer to the destination
	    network, not the local network.  Caused problems sending
	    RIP and HELLO networks and subnets

	15. 'Noannounce all' was not being appended to propagate
	    lists.

	16. EGP was not sending a POLL on transition to UP state.

	17. Missing extern in front of a data definition in egp.h

These are the changes between 1.9.1.7 and 2.0 beta

	1.  New parser.  The config file is parsed with lex and yacc
	    (flex and bison if you have them).  The grammer has been
	    totally redefined and is much more consistent.

	2.  Enhanced policy.  Routes can be listened to and propagated
	    by protocol, AS, interface, source gateway and
	    route.  The route being used is specified by a
	    preference.  Metrics are never translated and specifable
	    by destination and source.  Masks may be used when
	    matching routes.

	3.  Border Gateway Protocol.  BGP has been implemented
	    according to RFC-1105.  The exception being that the only
	    directions supported are internal and horizontal.
	    Internal BGP has not been fully implemented.  Matching on
	    AS paths is not yet possible (but being worked on).

	4.  Exterior Gateway Protocol.  EGP was rewritten to be fully
	    conformant to RFC-904.  Active and Passive modes are
	    supported.  Unsolicited updates are sent as soon as the
	    peer is in the UP state, but not at any other time, which
	    causes network reachability to be exchanged much sooner.

	5.  RIP should be compliant with RFC-1058.  Flash updates are
	    now supported correctly.

	6.  Network Management.  SNMP MIB-II is supported with
	    NYSERnet's SNMP 3.4 but patches are required (I have to
	    check on availability).  Also generates SNMP traps. SGMP
	    is no longer supported.

	7.  Tracing options have been expanded.  Detailed tracing of
	    packets and state machines is possible.

	8.  Reconfiguration.  A SIGHUP will cause complete
	    reconfiguration at any time.  It should be possible to
	    enable and disable protocols without restarting gated.

	9.  ICMP redirects may be disabled.  This will cause gated to
	    try to delete any ICMP redirects that have been installed
	    in the kernel.  Also, tracing of all received ICMP packets
	    is possible.

	10. Selective compilation.  It is possible to compile gated
	    with just the protocols required by changing `#define's to
	    `#undef's in config.h.

	11. Major internal rewrite.  Support for multiple timers per
	    protocol.  Tasks to deal with events.

	12. Gated state dump on SIGINT will fork() a child on systems
	    that support fork().  This allows the state dump to start
	    immediately without affecting the routing protocols.

	13. Point-to-point interfaces (i.e. SLIP) are now referenced
	    exclusively by their destination address.  This allows
	    systems that support it to assign the same local address
	    to many SLIP interfaces.

These are the changes between 1.5 and 1.9.1.2:

	1.  Gated does all string comparisons with strcasecmp and
	    strncasecmp so configuration files are case independent.

	2.  Gated will allow a static route of protocol rip with a
	    metric zero (interface route).  Incoming RIP routes with a
	    metric of zero will be converted to a metric of 1.

        3.  Support for NYSERnet's SNMP 3.1 (with a patch to SNMP).

        4.  Gated was not ignoring RIP packets from itself.

	5.  Additional logging of reasons for EGP errors.  The EGP
	    metric learned from EGP peers is now stored seperately from
	    the internal metric.

	6.  Support for reconstitutemetric has been removed.

	7.  Signal processing was improved to prevent the overlapping
	    processing of two different signals.

These are the changes between 1.3.1.36 and 1.5:

	1.  The EGP code will successfully inform a peer requesting
	    EGP version 3 or higher that we can only speak EGP version
	    2.  A future release of gated should support EGP version 3.

	2.  The announcetoAS and noannouncetoAS clauses were added to
	    control the propogation of exterior routing information
	    between other autonomous systems and the interior protocols.
	    The restrict/norestrict parameter specifies whether announce
	    statements apply when announcing these exterior routes.

	3.  Gated now explictly ignores the default net via EGP
	    (0.0.0.0) unless the 'acceptdefault' option is used on the
	    egpneighbor clause.  The generation of default when peering
	    with an EGP neighbor may be disabled with the 'nogendefault'
	    option.  Default may be propogated via EGP by using the
	    'defaultout' option.

	4.  The interior time delay metric of all networks received from
	    an EGP neighbor may be set with the 'metricin' option of the
	    egpneighbor clause.  The EGP distance assigned to all
	    networks advertized via EGP may be set with the
	    'egpmetricout' option.

	5.  The AS number of an EGP neighbor may be verified with the
	    'ASin' option of the egpneighbor clause.  The AS number used
	    when sending packets to an EGP neighbor may be specified on
	    a per-neighbor basis by using the 'ASout' clause.

	6.  If the 'egpmaxacquire' clause is not specifed, all EGP
	    neighbors will be acquired.

	7.  The default gateway specified in the 'defaultgateway' clause
	    will be reinstalled whenever a route to the default net
	    (0.0.0.0) times out, or the relevent EGP peers are lost.

	8.  When a network enters hold down, a HOLDOWN message is
	    issued.

	9.  Pointtopoint is now accepted as an alias for pointopoint.

	10. Restrictions on which networks are accepted from an EGP
	    neighbor is possible by specifying the 'validate' option on
	    the 'egpneighbor' clause and making use of the 'validAS'
	    clause.

	11. The egpneighbor clause was enhanced with the 'intf' and
	    'sourcenet' options.  The 'intf' option allows the
	    specification of the interface used to source EGP packets
	    when peering with non-immediate neighbors.  The 'sourcenet'
	    option is used to specify the source net specified in EGP NR
	    poll commands.  Both of these options are for EGP testing
	    purposes only.  Routes learned from non-immediate neighbors
	    will not be added to the routing table.

	12. The internal metric of routes to directly connected
	    interfaces is set to the interface metric (translated into a
	    delay in ms) instead of zero.  The metric advertized out
	    other interfaces for this net will now be proportional to
	    the interface metric.  Routes to directly connected
	    interfaces will still be prefered to other routes, unless
	    the route to an interface times out.

	13. The file /etc/gated.version is written on startup listing
	    the gated version, compilation date, start time and pid.

	14. The first version of an interface between gated and
	    NYSERnet's SGMP 2.2 is installed.

	15. On receipt of a SIGUSR1, the {no,}announcetoAS and validAS
	    clauses are re-read and replaced if error free.

	16.  Gated now supports SUNOS 4.0, Ultrix 3.0 and VAX/VMS
	     Multinet.

	17. RIP request packets are processed as specified in RFC1058
	    with the exception that requests from off-net hosts will use
	    the interface "closest" to the querying host as the basis
	    for split-horizion and announcment restrictions.  This is
	    because UDP does not pass gated any indication of which
	    interface the packet was destined for.

	    Sun's enhancements to RIP are also supported, except that
	    the POLL command has split horizon and announcment
	    restrictions applied to the result.

	18. The default protocol specification has been changed from:
	    EGP yes, RIP no, HELLO no to RIP yes, EGP no, HELLO no.  If the
	    configuration file is missing or unreadable, gated will
	    procede using default configuration information.

	    If the configuration file does not exist, the system has only
	    one interface, and a default route exists in the kernel's
	    routing tables, gated will exit with a warning message.

	19. The "hello" and "rip" tracing options now only display the
	    packet headers.  To display the contents of routing updates,
	    they must be used in conjunction with the "update" option.

	20. The interface timeout, and detection of interface up/down
	    and down/up transitions has been improved.

	21. Code has been added to trace ICMP redirects.  The ICMP
	    redirect processing code has been improved.


These are the changes between 1.3.1 and 1.3.1.36:

	1.  The EGP code and been reworked by Thomas Narten.  Most
	    importantly, the timing has been improved.  In addition,
	    gated will now log important EGP state changes to the
	    syslog. 

	    EGP packet processing has been fixed on non-VAXen (i.e.
	    forward byte order machines).

	    Gated now properly checks for and does not send information
	    about the shared net in EGP updates.  Information about
	    other gateways on the same net is propogated correctly.

	    The reason for not including a net in an EGP update is
	    explained in more detail.

	    If a 'noannounce' clause is used, gated will now send all
	    non-restricted routes with the metric specified in the
	    'defaultegpmetric' (or 255) as documented.

	    Only class A, B or C networks are included in EGP updates. 
	    Updates received with non-class A,B or C networks are
	    considered to be in error and are ignored.

	    EGP packet tracing has been enhanced.  More detail of EGP
	    update packets may be obtained by defining EGP_UPDATE_FORMAT
            in the Makefile.

	    EGP storage allocation errors have been fixed.  These
	    occured when more than one network was specified on multiple
	    'egpnetsreachable' clauses or when 'noannounce' statements
	    were used. 

	    Global and per-neighbor EGP information is now included in
	    the dump file.

	2.  Sun OS 3.4 does not properly handle two subnetted networks,
	    gated has been modified to recognize this condition.

	3.  The RIP to HELLO translation table has been updated at the
	    suggestion of Dave Mills.  HELLO processing has been
	    modified to more closely resemble that of the Fuzzball. 

	    HELLO routes must be 25% better or worse than the existing
	    route for a change to occur (better to switch to a HELLO
	    route, worse to update the metric in use).  Previously the
	    comparison was a fixed 100ms.

	    Gated now recognizes the Fuzzball holddown bit and ignores
	    the route, unless it is the current route, then the timer is
	    reset so that the route does not expire.  A message is
	    printed when a route in use is in Fuzzball holddown.

	    When the number of nets to be sent exceeds the size of a
            HELLO packet, partial HELLO packets are generated.  Gated
	    has always been able to receive partial HELLOs.

	    Gated now sets the date field in the HELLO packet to zero
	    with the two high-order bits set to indicate that the date
	    field is invalid.

	4.  A new define is supported, LOG_FACILITY, that allows gated's
	    syslog output to be redirected on systems that support the
	    BSD 4.3 syslog facility.  This will assist in dealing with
	    the volume of syslog information gated can produce.

	5.  An rcsid variable has been added to each source file to aid
	    in identifing the revision level of gated.  The version ID
	    of gated in general is derived from the latest revision
	    level of the individual source files.

	6.  Limited support for fixed metrics.  The 'fixedmetric' clause
	    in the configuration file allows a fixed metric per
	    interface per protocol (RIP or HELLO).  All outbound metrics
	    on the specified interface that are not infinity will be set
	    to the specified metric.  A default route generated with
	    'RIP gateway' or 'HELLO gateway' is not affected by a
	    fixedmetric clause.

	7.  When a currently active route comes in as infinity or
	    greater, gated logs an UNREACHABLE message.

	8.  IBM PC/RT BSD 4.3 (ACIS) is now supported by gated by use of
	    the RT43 define in the Makefile.  The HiC complier must be
	    used as Pcc does not seem to function properly.

	9.  Trace file processing has been enhanced.  The file is
	    completely closed when tracing is disabled.  Messages are
	    logged in the syslog when tracing is toggled.  

	    Traceflags may be specified in the configuration file and
	    may be changed dynamically.

	10. Martian filtering has been added to gated.  Routing
	    information about networks in the 'martian' list is ignored
	    from all sources.  The compiled in 'martain' list (in
	    rt_control.h) may be appended to with the 'martiannets'
	    clause of the configuration file.  The dump file displays
	    the list of martian networks in use.

	11. On all systems except BSD42 or UTX32_1_X, getdtablesize() is
	    used.

	12. Processing of interface timeouts is improved.

	    A message is printed when an interface times out.

	    The metric of the interface route is reset to prevent it
	    from increasing if a couple of routing packets are missed.

	   EGP packets will reset the interface route timer.  Further
	   checking has been added to prevent interfaces from timing out
	   if RIP and HELLO are not being used.

	   MSG_DONTROUTE is used for sendto calls to prevent EGP packets
	   from taking an alternate path if the interface route has
	   timed out.

These are the changes in version 1.3.1 of gated from the previous
versions of gated:

	1.  There is now a version ID number.  This new version
	    is known as 1.3.1.

	2.  In the gated.conf file, all references to a PTP interface
	    must use the DESTINATION address.  This is exactly opposite
	    the old versions which used the source address of a PTP link.
	    This is the only change you should have to make for
	    compatibility with your existing gated.conf.

	3.  Split-horizon is implemented properly.  This includes
	    with flash-updates.  Split horizon has been fixed in the
	    parallel protocol environment.  (see my message to the
	    nsfnet mailing list)

	4.  The code has been cleaned up and made as consistent as
	    possible.  the syslog utility has been used extensively.

	5.  certain source files were merged and renamed for
	    consistency.

	6.  PTP links are dealt with more consistently.  The kludge for
	    SLIPnet links is gone.

	7.  There is a 2 minute hold down for all protocols.

	8.  The interface code has been beefed up considerably.
            You can now change interface flags on the fly without
	    restarting gated.  gated checks them every 30 seconds.
	    You can change a netmask, address, metric, and broadcast
	    address without stopping gated.  You must first ifconfig
	    the interface down (for about 15 seconds) and then bring
	    it back up.  gated will make the changes.  You need not
	    bring the interface down/up for only flag changes.

	9.  Interfaces are dynamically timed out.  An interface timer
	    will time out when no RIP or HELLO packets are being
	    received on that interface.  imp interfaces send a
	    RIP/HELLO packet to itself over the interface. that is
	    how an imp interface timer is checked.  Interfaces that
	    have been timed out automatically are re-installed in
	    the routing tables when they come back.  Of course, if
	    you are not a RIP or HELLO supplier, interfaces will NOT
	    be timed out.

	10. A config file option has been added to prevent the timing
	    out of certain interfaces.  THe sytax is as follows:

	    passiveinterfaces int_addr [int_addr] ......

	    The interfaces listed will not participate in the routing
	    timeout scheme described in CHANGE #9.   Remember, the
	    PTP interfaces listed must be specified with their
	    destination address.

	11. RIP now listens and propagates HOST routes.  This was the
	    strategy taken for dealing with PTP routes in a consistent
	    manner.  Any route learned via a HOST redirect wil NOT
	    be propagated.  A route learned via any REDIRECT will not
	    be propagated.

	12. The internal gated routing tables have been merged into one.
	    Also, the hashing fuction for the route table now parallels
	    the one used by the 4.3BSD kernel.

	13. Support for host static routes and host restrictions have been
	    added.  THe new config file keywords for the hosts are:

	    announcehost
	    donotannouncehost
	    donotlistenhost

	    The whole syntax remains the same as the net restriction and
	    static syntax:

	    "keyword" host_addr intf int_addr ... proto {rip|egp|hello} ...

	    For static host routes:

	    host host_addr gateway gate_addr metric # {rip|hello|egp}

	    Please see the man page for the complete syntax.

	14. Flash-update code has been fixed.  Split-horizon and
	    restrictions are applied properly.  Also, instead of sending
	    out a burst of RIP packets with one changed net in each,
	    one packet is sent with the changed routes for the flash
	    update period.

	15. the RIP_TRACE* commands are implemented.

	16. The HELLO default route is now mapped into the UNIX default
	    when there is no UNIX default route available.  The HELLO
	    default (net 10) is first processed as net 10 by UNIX.  If
	    there is no default gateway in the routing tables, UNIX
	    treats this HELLO net 10 as the UNIX default 0.0.0.0 and
	    actually installs a default route. This way, an NSFnet
	    backbone site should never be without a default if their
	    local default (ARPA gateway) goes away.

	17. The RIP to HELLO, and the HELLO to RIP metric mapping was
	    changed.  Look in mapmetric() in rt_table.c for the
	    details.

	18. All metrics are stored internally by gated as time-delay in
	    milliseconds.  The RIP metric is mapped to HELLO and processed.

	19. The notion of subnet interfaces are supported.  This way,
	    subnets don't get RIPped where people don't want them to.
	    If a gateway is gatewaying 2 subnetted class B networks,
	    the subnet routes are not propagated where they shouldn't be.
	    Just the Class B network is RIPped to the appropriate interface.

	20. Sending gated a SIGINT, will cause it to dump its routing
	    knowledge to /usr/tmp/gated_dump.
	    (kill -INT `cat /etc/gated.pid`)   Once this signal is
	    received by gated, it will schedule a the dump to take place
	    within the next 60 seconds (MAXIMUM).

	21. a config option to filter on the source of information for a
	    specified network or host has been added.  For example:

	    listen 128.84 gateway 128.121.50.1 128.121.51.5 proto rip

	    This means to only listen to information about 128.84 from
	    gateways 128.121.50.1 and 128.121.50.5 via the protocol rip.
	    Ignore all other information about 128.84

	    The same is true for a host:

	    listenhost 128.84.1.1 gateway 128.121.50.5 proto rip
	    
	    
	22. Support was added to handle interface metrics for those
	    primitive systems that don't support it.  In the conf file:

	    interfacemetric int_addr metric#

	    interfacemetric 128.84.253.200 5

	    You must have one line for each interface you want to provide
	    a metric for.  Also, this will override your systems interface
	    metric if the system supports it (ala 4.3BSD).
	    
	23. Metric Reconstitution was added (even though it is very
	    dangerous).  This one is for Chuck at Rutgers!  :^)
	    in the conf file:

	    reconstmetric int_addr metric#

	    reconstmetric 128.84.238.200 6

	    This means that any RIP information coming into this interface
	    will get its metric set to 6 (except infinity of course).  THis
	    is a dangerous loop creator.  USE WITH CAUTION.

	24. Sending gated a SIGHUP will toggle its debugging.  Example:

	    Start gated with "-tierp" flags to /tmp/gated.log.  It is now
	    logging.  Send a kill -HUP `cat /etc/gated.pid`, the following
	    happens:

		- logging is terminated
	        - /tmp/gated.log (or whatever you are using!) is closed.

	     rm gated.log or mv it

	     send another kill -HUP:

	        - /tmp/gated.log is created and opened (appended to if
	          already there)
		- logging is turned back on (whatever was specified in
	          the command line)

	     This is useful in having rotating log files much like syslog
	     does.

	25.  Machines now supported include: SunOS 3.X, BSD4.2, Gould UTX/32
	     (see Makefile for supported machines)

	26.  Miscellaneous small nagging bugs were fixed.

	27.  Gated now keeps a list of active gateways (participating
	     in a supported routing protocol) per interface. The list
	     includes the address of the gateway, what routing protocols
	     are being used by that gateway and a timer.  I found this
	     necessary in dealing with split horizon in a parallel
	     routing protocol environment.

	28.  Gated was linted down to 2 lines of the fluffy stuff....

	29.  The "announce" and "noannounce" statements in the config
	     file can now be applied on a per interface basis instead
	     of only globally.  Previous versions of gated only allowed
	     the specification of either the "announce" or "noannounce"
	     separate, but never together.  There was no change of
	     syntax, gated internals were just made smarter.
	     The first "{no}announce net# intf all ....." will make
	     gated apply the clause globally because you specified all
	     interfaces.
