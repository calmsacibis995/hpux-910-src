 * authdes.c -  dummy encryption routines for destinations outside the USA.
 *
 * Sorry, folks; I hate this, too. Send me your e-mail address in an
 * envelope bearing a US postmark and I'll send you the decryption key
 * for the des program normally distributed with Unix in the USA. Outside
 * the USA you are on your own; however, you should be able quickly to
 * obtain the source from lots of places, homegrown or otherwise.
 *
 * to decrypt the des routine, mumble the following:
 *
 * des -d -k key authdes.c.des authdes.c
 *
 * , where key is as above, and rebuild. To restore the distribution
 * to its exportable state, copy this file to authdes.c .
