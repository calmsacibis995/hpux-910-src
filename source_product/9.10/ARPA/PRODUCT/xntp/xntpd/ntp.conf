# Sample XNTP Configuration File
#  (refer to xntpd(1m) for details)
#
# Use "peer", "server" and "broadcast " statements to specify various time
# servers to be used and/or time services to be provided.
#
# Peer: The peer statement specifies that the given host is to be polled
#       in "symmetric active" mode. The syntax is :
#       peer addr [ key# ] [ version# ] [ minpoll interval_in_sec ] [ prefer ]
#
## peer   128.116.64.3 key 2001 version 2
#
#
# Server: The server statement causes polling to be done in client mode rather
#         than symmetric active mode.  It is an alternative to the peer command
#         above.  Which to use depends on what you want to achieve. 
#         The syntax is:
#     server addr [ key # ] [ version # ] [ minpoll interval_in_sec ] [ prefer ]
#
## server 128.8.10.1   key 2000 minpoll 6 prefer
#
#
# Broadcast: The broadcast statement tells it to start broadcasting time 
#            out one of its interfaces.  The syntax is:
#       broadcast addr [ key # ] [ version # ] [ minpoll interval_in_sec ] 
#
## broadcast 128.100.49.255 # [ key n ] [ version n ]
#
#
#
# broadcastclient: Tells the daemon whether it should attempt to sync
#                  to broadcasts or not.  Defaults to `no'.
#
## broadcastclient yes # or no
#
#
#
# broadcastdelay: Configures in a default round-trip delay to use for
#                 broadcast time (in seconds).  The defaults is 0.008 second. 
#
## broadcastdelay 0.008	
#
#
#
# Precision: The default is -6. Unless there is a good reason to do so, this
#          value should not be changed from the default value.
#
## precision -6
#
#
#
# Drift file:  Put this in a directory which the daemon can write to. No 
#              symbolic links allowed.
#
## driftfile /usr/contrib/etc/ntp.drift
#
#
# authenticate: Enables/disables strict authentication mode (or not).
#               The default is no (disabled).
#
## authenticate yes	# or no. 
#
#
#
# authdelay: The time (in seconds) it takes to do an NTP encryption
#	     on this host. Use "authspeed -m npt.keys" to find the value
#	     on s300/400 hp-ux.
#
## authdelay 0.000189
#
#
# trustedkey: The keys defined here are used when 'authenticate' is on, meaning
#             we only trust (and sync to) peers who know and use these keys.
#
## trustedkey 1 3 4 8
#
#
# keys: Specifies the file which holds the authentication keys.
#
## keys /usr/contrib/etc/ntp.keys
#
# controlkey: Indicates which key is to be used for validating
#             mode 6 "write variables" commands.  If this isn't defined, no
#             mode 6 "write variables" commands will be done by the xntpd.
#
#               ntpq is mode-6
#               ntptrace is mode-6
#               xntpdc is mode-7
#
## controlkey 65534	   # mode-6 request
## requestkey 65535        # mode-7 requests
#
#
# restrict: This option places restrictions on one or more systems.
#           This is implemented as a sorted address-and-mask list, with 
#           each entry including a set of flags which define what a host 
#           matching the entry *CANNOT* do.
#           The syntax is :
#             restrict address [ mask numeric mask ] [ flag ] 
#
#           The flags are:
#
#             ignore	- ignore all traffic from host
#             noserve	- don't give host any time (but let him make queries?)
#             notrust	- give the host time, and let it query, but don't
#                         sync to it.
#             noquery	- host can have time, but cannot make queries
#             nomodify	- allow the host to make queries except those which are
#		          actually run-time configuration commands.
#             ntpport	- Makes matches for this entry only if the source 
#                         port is the standard NTP UDP port (123).
# 
#           Examples:
#
#              restrict 129.140.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 notrust nomodify
#
#                  The matching machines can be served time, but will be
#                  restricted to making non-modifying queries.
#
#              restrict 15.1.15.1 ignore 
#
#                  Ignore all packets from host 15.1.15.1.
# 
#              restrict 35.1.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 noserve nomodify 
#
#                  Restrict 35.1.1.0 to queries only.
# 
#              restrict 128.116.64.3 noquery
#
#                  Take time from the 128.116.64.3, but don't let it query.
#
#
# statsdir: Indicates the full path of the directory where statistics files 
#           should be created. Be sure to end the name with a slash ("/").
#
## statsdir /usr/contrib/etc/ntpstats/
#
#
# statistics: Enables writing of statistics records (loopstats, peerstats).
#
## statistics loopstats
## statistics peerstats
#
# filegen:  Configures how the statistics file sets are generated.
#           Provides a means for handling files that are continously growing 
#           during the lifetime of a server.
# 
# 	    The syntax is:
# 	       filegen statsname [ file filename ] [ type typename ]  \
#	            [ link/nolink ] [ enable/disable ]
#
## filegen loopstats file loopstat type week link 
## filegen peerstats file loopstat type week link 
# 
#
# Local clock: Allow this server to synchronize to its own clock.
#
## server 127.127.1.1 
#
# Spectracom Netclock/2 clocks: synchronize to netclock/2 which receives WWVB.
#
## server 127.127.4.1
