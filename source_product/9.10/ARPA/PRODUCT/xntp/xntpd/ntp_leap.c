 * ntp_leap - maintain leap bits and take action when a leap occurs
 */
# include <stdio.h>

# include "ntpd.h"

/*
 * This module is devoted to maintaining the leap bits and taking
 * action when a leap second occurs.  It probably has bugs since
 * a leap second has never occurred to excercise the code.
 *
 * The code does two things when a leap second occurs.  It first
 * steps the clock one second in the appropriate direction.  It
 * then informs the reference clock code, if compiled in, that the
 * leap second has occured so that any clocks which need to disable
 * themselves can do so.  This is done within the first few seconds
 * after midnight, UTC.
 *
 * The code maintains two variables which may be written externally,
 * leap_warning and leap_indicator.  Leap_warning can be written
 * any time in the month preceeding a leap second.  24 hours before
 * the leap is to occur, leap_warning's contents are copied to
 * leap_indicator.  The latter is used by reference clocks to set
 * their leap bits.
 *
 * The module normally maintains a timer which is arranged to expire
 * just after 0000Z one day before the leap.  On the day a leap might
 * occur the interrupt is aimed at 2200Z and every 5 minutes thereafter
 * until 1200Z to see if the leap bits appear.
