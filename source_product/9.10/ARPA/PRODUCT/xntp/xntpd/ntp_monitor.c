 * I'm still not sure I like what I've done here.  It certainly consumes
 * memory like it is going out of style, and also may not be as low
 * overhead as I'd imagined.
 *
 * Anyway, we record statistics based on source address, mode and version
 * (for now, anyway.  Check the code).  The receive procedure calls us with
 * the incoming rbufp before it does anything else.
 *
 * Each entry is doubly linked into two lists, a hash table and a
 * most-recently-used list.  When a packet arrives it is looked up
 * in the hash table.  If found, the statistics are updated and the
 * entry relinked at the head of the MRU list.  If not found, a new
 * entry is allocated, initialized and linked into both the hash
 * table and at the head of the MRU list.
 *
 * Memory is usually allocated by grabbing a big chunk of new memory
 * and cutting it up into littler pieces.  The exception to this when we
 * hit the memory limit.  Then we free memory by grabbing entries off
 * the tail for the MRU list, unlinking from the hash table, and
 * reinitializing.
