/*
 * This code keeps a simple address-and-mask list of hosts we want
 * to place restrictions on (or remove them from).  The restrictions
 * are implemented as a set of flags which tell you what the host
 * can't do.  There is a subroutine entry to return the flags.  The
 * list is kept sorted to reduce the average number of comparisons
 * and make sure you get the set of restrictions most specific to
 * the address.
 *
 * The algorithm is that, when looking up a host, it is first assumed
 * that the default set of restrictions will apply.  It then searches
 * down through the list.  Whenever it finds a match it adopts the match's
 * flags instead.  When you hit the point where the sorted address is
 * greater than the target, you return with the last set of flags you
 * found.  Because of the ordering of the list, the most specific match
 * will provide the final set of flags.
 *
 * This was originally intended to restrict you from sync'ing to your
 * own broadcasts when you are doing that, by restricting yourself
 * from your own interfaces.  It was also thought it would sometimes
 * be useful to keep a misbehaving host or two from abusing your primary
 * clock.  It has been expanded, however, to suit the needs of those
 * with more restrictive access policies.
