Welcome to version 4.7 of bind (Beta Test 3).

There have been several changes to the named boot file (/etc/named.boot)
that you should be aware of.  "domain" has been obsoleted and is no
longer recognized (it generates a warning message), and the term
"suffixes", which was added in version 4.7alpha, has been removed.

The manual page on named (named.8) has been updated to reflect all
these changes.  Please read this and look at the example files
before installation.  You should also note the changes in the
resolver code to support non-fully-qualified addresses and per-user
host aliases.  See hostname(7) for an overview.

There have been numerous changes to named, fixing most of the known
bugs that can be fixed without major structural changes in the server.
Several server configurations that failed before should now work.
Certain robustness problems have been fixed, in particular bounds-
checking when processing incoming packets.

The root "hint" cache and cache file remain the largest problem area,
along with named's naivete in accepting bogus server's data.
These will be addressed in the next release, along with asynchronous
zone transfers, intelligent reloading of zone files, and faster startup.

This version (4.7) will replace the previously-fielded version (4.5).
Version 4.5 has a serious bug that causes the generation of a continuous
stream of bogons to the root domain servers (bogus queries with the query
response bit set and possibly garbage for nsid and rcode).  It is imperative
that these versions of named be replaced as fast as possible.  I urge you to
field 4.7 quickly, for the sake of the root domain servers.
