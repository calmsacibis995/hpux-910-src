# Standard configuration file for DTC Device File Access program.
#  Copyright (C) 1992 by HEWLETT-PACKARD.
#
#
#  This file contains association between  physical terminal server ports
#  and  device file name. The device name is used by the end-user
#  application to identify a port or access a remote port using
#  device file access interface.
#
#
#  The remote identification is composed of a single IP address
#  (associated to a port) or an IP address (specifying the remote client)
#  and a board number/port number for terminal server.
#
#  That file is used by the DDFA parser (/etc/dpp).
#
# The following format must be  used:
#
#  IP_address   board/port device_file_name  port_config_file
#
#  EX:
#  11.234.87.123  00/00   /dev/dtcportO0    /etc/newconfig/ddfa/pcf
#  11.234.87.123  00/00   /dev/dtcportI0   
#  11.234.87.124  XX/279  /dev/dtcportI1    /etc/newconfig/ddfa/pcf 
# 
#  NOTE:
#
#   first and third entries are used for DDFA purpose. The last one is used
#   for PAD SUP accessing PAD port through a DTC.
#
#   second entry is used for port identification.
