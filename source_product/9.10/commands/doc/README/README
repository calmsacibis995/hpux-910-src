This  directory,  /etc/newconfig,  contains  new  versions of HP-UX core
product  configuration  files  and  shell  scripts  which  may have been
customized  (localized)  on your system.  Old versions in their  regular
locations in the filesystem are not overwritten by the update process.

You may wish to compare these new versions with the counterparts in your
filesystem, and incorporate  some or all of the changes for this update.

These files MAY not have changed since the previous  HP-UX  release.  If
you  wish,  you may  modify  or remove  any or all of the  files in this
directory without affecting your system's operation.
