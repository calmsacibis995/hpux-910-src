The following files are NOT source files for cron/crontab/at but
are put here for the sake of completeness (and also to make the
make process easier).  These files are: at.allow, cron.allow, 
queuedefs and .proto.  Please look into the Makefile to see how
they are used.  They normally belong to the /usr/lib/cron directory.


11/1/88 - R. Campbell
The XPG3 standard calls for 'at' to recognize 'next' as an increment,
as in "next Monday".  This is curremtly provided for in the function
'parsedatetime()' in pdt.c as long as 'at' is compiled under NLS.
Otherwise a yacc program 'yyparse()' is supposed to be called.
The instructions to create yyparse() are no longer in the makefile.
If we ever need to build w/o NLS, the ability to recognize 'next' should
be included in att1.y and this should be created in the makefile.
