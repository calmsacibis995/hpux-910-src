# LOCALIZERS:
# In all of the following only item_name and item_selection can be translated.
# If needed, translate the string to the right of "=" sign; but do NOT
# translate $tsm_hot_key. You can translate the letter following $tsm_hot_key
# if you've changed the key mappings. In such a case, translate c/p to
# the new mappings. To change mappings see "!in_window_mode_prompt_popup" in
# tsmtext file.
#
# The item_selection corresponds to the letter which can be entered by the
# user to quickly select this item instead of using the arrow keys, when the
# sub-submenu is displayed.  Only a single character can be speicifed.
#
# WARNING:
# Make sure you are consistent between key mappings and item_selection letters.
