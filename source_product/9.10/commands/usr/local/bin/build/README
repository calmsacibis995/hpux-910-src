The commands build process consists of three scripts; buildit, nbp, and build.
The nbp script resides on the build system in the real root and builds the 
entire core commands product using the buildit script.  The buildit script 
resides on hpfclx3 in the pseudo root.  The buildit script executes a make 
default and a make install on the specified target.  It also is responsible 
for maintaining the compile, compile.err, install, and install.err files in
the report directory.  Finally, the build script is used on the DBE system,
hpfcdbe, to provide developers with a mechanism for building specific targets
of the core commands product.
