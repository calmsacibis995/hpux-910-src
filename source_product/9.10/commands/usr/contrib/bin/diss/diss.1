.SH WARNINGS
.I Diss 
primarily understands the a.out format introduced with the
7.40 Languages release.  Earlier formats are not compatible in all
respects (i.e.  some of the above options may produce no output or
garbage).
.PP
The symbolic-debug tables (produced with the
.B \-g
compiler option) or their extension header
cannot be dumped with
.IR diss(1) ;
use
.I dsymtab(1)
instead.
