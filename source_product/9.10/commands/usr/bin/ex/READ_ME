# @(#) $Revision: 64.2 $    
This is version 3 (3.9) of the editor.

Version 2 corresponds to version 3 without the enhancements in 3.
There is no reason to use 2 unless you have a pdp-11 that does not have
overlay software, since 3 contains all the bug fixes and some new features.

The include file local/uparm.h should be installed, as ex_tune.h needs it.
The contents of this include file can be modified if you wish to place
the editor in a nonstandard location.

Conditional compilation flags:
	-DTRACE		for debugging
	-DVFORK		for UCB Vax/Unix with the vfork system call.
	-DCRYPT		-x option to edit encrypted files


*******************************************************************************

The CRYPT-specific portions of ex have extracted from ex_temp.c into a new
source file ex_crypt.c.  This file resides in the crypt subdirectory of the
shared source.  When compiling with CRYPT defined, this new file must be
present.

*******************************************************************************
There are two non HP-UX editors that are ifdef'd into the ex/vi source.
One is ed1000 (ifdef ED1000) and the other is vi for MPE (ifdef HPE).
We agreed to allow these ifdef's into vi on the condition that we have
absolutely no responsibility for maintaining the ifdef'd code.
Moreover, when we make a bug fix to vi not only do we not make the
corresponding fix to the ifdef'd code but we also make no attempt to
verify that the fix doesn't break the ifdef'd code.

Alex Leontiev (1-746-5949) is the contact for this code.  Their project
does not use DTS but does use STARS.  Since we cannot forward STARS
defects from Fort Collins to Cupertino (forwarding between STARS sites
is impossible) of defects against ed1000 show up in our DTS database, we
must do the following:

BEFORE THE MERGE OF THE FORT COLLINS HP-UX STARS DATABASE WITH CUPERTINO

 Send Alex a copy of the defect.
 Resolve the defect as "fs" which will close it on DTS and put
   it into "ad" status on STARS.
 Request Diane Kallas (3149) to close it on STARS.
 Ask Alex to either have his STARS people or the submitter
   enter the defect against the product number 92562A, which is in
   Cupertino.


AFTER THE MERGE OF THE FORT COLLINS HP-UX STARS DATABASE WITH CUPERTINO

 Send Alex a copy of the defect.
 Resolve the defect as "fs" which will close it on DTS and put
   it into "ad" status on STARS.
 Request Diane Kallas (3149) to change the product number
   in the STARS defect to 92562A.
