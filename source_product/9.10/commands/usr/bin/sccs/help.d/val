*	Messages for val command of SCCS.
*
-1
"did not find the control line expected"
The SCCS file should have contained the control string specified
in the error message.  Run 'man sccsfile' for more information.
-2
"delta dates are out of sequence"
The delta date/time pairs contained in the delta table are not
in order.  This error can occur when deltas have been made during
a period when the system clock was set incorrectly.  This problem
must be fixed by the user, there is no tool to correct dates.
Run 'man sccsfile' for more information.
-3
"illegal control line"
The control sequence found in the file does not match any that
are legal.  Run 'man sccsfile' for more information.
-4
"unexpected end of file"
There is not sufficient information in this file to constitute
a complete SCCS file.  Run 'man sccsfile' for more information.
-5
"checksum error"
The checksum computed for the file does not match that contained
in the checksum line.  This may be fixed with admin -z.
Run 'man sccsfile' and 'man admin' for more information.
