/* audparamC.h - this is a converged version of the sys/audparam.h file
 *       used particularly by audisp(1M).
 *       It contains the parameter table for uses in system call
 *       auditing. The convergence is necessary because audisp has to
 *       understand records from both the 300 and 800 machines.
 */

/* NOTE: The max size of the audit record is decided at compile
 *	 time.  As additional system calls are added which can
 *	 be audited, the definition of MAX_AUD_DATA in
 *	 ../h/audit.h should be looked at.  If the new
 *	 system call may save data which could overrun
 *	 the array in audit_bdy_data, which is of size
 *	 MAX_AUD_DATA, MAX_AUD_DATA should be increased.
