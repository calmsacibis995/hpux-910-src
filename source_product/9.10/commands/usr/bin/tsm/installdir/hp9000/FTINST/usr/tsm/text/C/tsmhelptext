INTRODUCTION:

  TSM is a system that makes your terminal appear to be 10 "terminals".
  Each of these "terminals", called sessions, can run its own program
  with its own set of function keys. 

  There are three ways to operate TSM:

        1. By pressing a function key (if they are available).
        2. By pressing Control-T to access the TSM Menu Interface 
        3. by pressing Control-W to access the TSM Command Interface.

  If you are using TSM to run a program that needs a Control-W or Control-T,
  simply press the key TWICE to send the character to the program.

  To SELECT an item or value, use the [Return] key.

  To CANCEL a command or menu selection, use the [ESC] key (or space bar).



--------------------- Terminal Session Manager Help Text -------- Page  3 of 19

MENU INTERFACE:

  When you press Control-T ([CTRL]-[T]), you will see the menu interface.

  Use the terminal's UP and DOWN arrow keys to open a menu and move the
  cursor to highlight an item, then press [Return] to select the item or
  press the space bar to cancel.

  +--------------------- TSM Menu    Session 1: SHELL 1 ---------------------+
  |  Select   Run   Cut & paste   Print   Misc   Quit                        |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |  1 SHELL 1   ^W1  |
     |  2 SHELL 2   ^W2  |
     |  3 SHELL 3   ^W3  |
     +-------------------+

  Use the terminal's LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to switch to another menu.

  Press the space bar to cancel the menu interface. 


--------------------- Terminal Session Manager Help Text -------- Page  4 of 19

COMMAND INTERFACE:

  When you press Control-W ([CTRL-[W]), you will see the command interface.

    >>> TSM Session  1    '?' for Help <<<

  At the command interface you can press keys to perform various actions.

  For example: press [1] for session one, 
                     [2] for session two,
                     [3] for session three, ...
            or press
                     [Space Bar] to cancel, and return to the session,
            or press
                     [Return] to refresh the screen, and return to session,
            or press
                     [q] to quit TSM (confirm with [Y], cancel with [N]).

CUT and PASTE:   (continues on next screen)

  TSM allows you to cut text from one session and paste the text in another.
  To CUT text: start the command, position the cursor at the start of text,
  press Return, position the cursor at the end of text, and press Return.

  CUT Command:  [CTRL]-[W]  [c]  <position-1> [Return] <position-2> [Return] 

       where <position-1> and <position-2> are accomplished by using the
       arrow keys or by using:

   u or up-cursor    -- up one row        |   U -- Up to top row
   d or down-cursor  -- down one row      |   D -- Down to bottom row
   l or left-cursor  -- left one column   |   L -- Left to first column
   r or right-cursor -- right one column  |   R -- Right to last column

                a  (all)     -- pos1 is upper-left, pos2 is lower right
                e  (end)     -- pos1 at cursor, pos2 at last column
                c  (corner)  -- switch corner being positioned
                o  (outline) -- outline area being cut

--------------------- Terminal Session Manager Help Text -------- Page  8 of 19

CUT TYPES:       (continues on next screen)

  The CUT command with a cut-type OPTION:

   [CTRL]-[W]  [C]  <OPTION> <position-1> [Return] <position-2> [Return]

  Where OPTION is one of the following:

     [B] Block cut  -- cuts a rectangle of text (inserting newlines)
                       [CTRL]-[w] [c] [b] <pos-1> [Return] <pos-2> [Return]

     [S] String cut -- cuts lines of text (suppressing newlines)
                       [CTRL]-[w] [c] [s] <pos-1> [Return] <pos-2> [Return]

  CUT remembers and re-uses the last cut OPTION you specified.



--------------------- Terminal Session Manager Help Text -------- Page  9 of 19

PASTE from CUT:

  TSM allows you to cut text from one session and paste the text in another.

  PASTE command:    [CTRL]-[w] [p]

  When you PASTE, text will be entered into the current session, at the
  cursor, just as if you were typing the text.

  Make sure that the application to which you are pasting text is prepared
  to accept text. For example, vi should be in insert mode before pasting.

  Additional PASTE commands: [CTRL]-[W] and

        [>] [p]                     paste to printer (uses .tsmprint)
        [>] [f] <filename> [Return] paste to <filename> (cannot exist)
        [>] [a] <filename> [Return] paste to <filename> (append)
        [>] [o] <filename> [Return] paste to <filename> (overwrite)

  TSM will beep if an error occurs during a paste operation.

PRINTING:

  TSM can print to the standard HP-UX lp command. TSM also supports a local
  printer lp device attached to a terminal. See the TSM User's manual for
  details on how to connect a local printer.

  To print the current session display use:

    {CTRL]-[W] [o]      to OUTPUT the current screen to printer



SCREEN SAVER:

  When there is no activity, TSM will blank the screen:  

    [X] [s] [y]          start screen saver 
    [X] [s] [n]          disable the screen saver
