# TSM user customizable file:  .tsmkeys, used for TSM softkey initialization
#
# TSM will search along the following paths (in order) for this file name.
#     ./
#     $HOME/
#     /usr/tsm/
#
# It is recommended that you copy this file to $HOME/
# for customization.
#
# If tsm has not been installed in the standard path, /usr/tsm,
# then set the environment variable, $TSMPATH to the location of
# tsm directory on your system.
#
# If you do not want TSM to program your softkeys, comment out the line:
# 'function_keys=.tsmkeys' in your LOCAL copy of the file:  .tsm
#
# lines that begin with # are treated as comments

# Format: Two lines per softkey, A label line and a key contents line
# 
# The label line begins with an 'L', then a number to indicate which
# label, then a TAB character and then the text to be placed in the key
# label.  On HP terminals the label text will wrap at 8 characters so both
# lines of the softkey labels may be used.  All characters after the first
# whitespace character (TAB) following the 'L#' are put in the label,
# including whitespace.  Labels that are too long are truncated.
# 
# The key contents line begins with a number which indicates which key,
# then a TAB character and then the text to be transmitted (as if keys
# were pressed) when the softkey is pressed.  Typically these will be TSM
# commands but the text can be "anything" (see below for limitations and
# substitutions). Lines that are too long are truncated.
# 
# The first section of this file defines the contents of softkeys that
# have no "override" definition when a particular session is current.  The
# later sections define session dependent changes to the defaults
# programmed in the first section.  These later sections start with a
# session ID and end when another session ID is encountered.  The syntax
# for the session ID is 'W#' where # is a number indicating which session
# the definitions are active for.
# 
# Substitutions: There are special sequences that can be put in the
# text fields which expand to character sequences determined by TSM,
# they are:
# 
#   \p#  Expands to the program name as defined in the .tsm file
#        for session number #
#   \h   Expands to the current TSM command line hotkey sequence
#   \m   Expands to the current TSM menu hotkey sequence 
# 
# Limitations:  Certain control characters cannot be used in softkey
# programming because they may be interpreted by the terminal during the
# softkey programming sequence, they are:
# 
#   ^E   ENQ,  Don't use if terminal is set for ENQ/ACK handshake (HP)
#   ^S   XOFF, Don't use if terminal is set for XON/XOFF handshake
#   ^Q   XON,  Don't use if terminal is set for XON/XOFF handshake
