@(#) $Revision: 66.1 $

The command ied is a front-end filter that allows command-line editing
of the style of ksh to be used with any "dumb" command.  (Examples
include bc, dc, adb, and ed.)  It can even be used with cat, which
would make Dennis Ritchie's job of writing device drivers easier...
(sorry..).

In the simplest case, 

	ied <command>

gives you editing for that command.  

	ied sh

does work well (so does  ied ksh  and  ied csh ), and ied will not
interfere with the operation of programs such as vi.  (It doesn't do
any good, either, but the purpose is to have history when not in vi.)
The command ied provides several other features as described in the
manual page.

There are a couple of problems with ied in certain usages.  These 
are actually kernel bugs, and I could find no way to work around them
from user space; they are pty bugs.  Don't let these discourage you; it
takes a pty-smart application to cause the problem in the first place,
so most usages will work quite well.  I hope the kernel bugs can be
fixed for 7.0.

    S300:
    For a few commands (specifically shl and ied itself) the characters
    sent to the application will be "one behind" the characters typed
    to the keyboard, but only in some modes of the application.  This
    is obvious, and is always fixed by using the -x option.  (But
    EOF then breaks, as described in the manual page.)  (6.5 behavior;
    6.2 would hang up but time out.)

    S800:
    There is a combination of bugs in pty such that certain commands
    (again specifically shl and ied itself) either refuse to run at
    all or hang up solidly (and unkillably from the keyboard).  (3.0
    behavior; 2.x was the same as 6.2.)  The -x option simply doesn't
    work at all because of another bug.

The command ied does come with a "shrink-wrap" agreement.  By obtaining
the file containing the ied object, you are agreeing to the following.

1) It is currently available only for HP internal use.  (I think it
   might be useful enough to put into HP-UX; if so I don't want to have
   copies outside.  Also, I want more exposure before dissemenating it
   widely.)

2) You agree that you will update to any new versions that come out, or
   expect to meet with derision at best if you attempt to get support
   on an old version.

3) You agree to provide the derision above if you encounter a question
   on a version you know to be obsolete.

4) You agree to keep this notice with ied if you pass it on to anyone
   and agree to inform them of new versions.
    
5) You agree to provide me with reports on any bugs you may find.  Of
   particular interest are commands that "should" work and don't.

Since it contains a large amount of licensed source, I'm uncomfortable
with posting the source (for obvious reasons) but I'm more than willing
to provide it on a "no warranty" basis if requested and you have the
appropriate licenses.
