/ Halgol script to dial a ventel modem. (rdg 4/10/85)
/
/ usage: 
/   /usr/lib/uucp/X25/opx25 -fventel.out -v -nphone# >/dev/culxx </dev/culxx
/   ie, as from cu:
/	cu -lcul09 -qem dir
/	Connected
/	~&opx25 -fventel.out -v -n9\&2238325 >/dev/cul09 </dev/cul09

/ first wakeup the modem:
	echo "attempting wakeup...\r\n"
	send "\r"
/ the next command is a trick to waste some time - the modem needs a 
/ short pause between the CR's - less than 1 second, but more than none.
/ warning: this might fail if the system is exceptionally slow or fast.
	run sleep 0
	send "\r"
	expect 3 "$"
	error wfail

/ now dial the number:
	echo "attempting dial...\r\n"
	send "k"
	expect 2 ":"
	error dfail
	send "\#\r"

/ wait for ONLINE message:
	echo "waiting for call to complete...\r\n"
/ for some phone numbers, the 30 second alarm in the 
/ next line might not be enough.
	expect 30 "ONLINE"
	error cfail
	echo "\r\ncall completed!\r\n"
	exit 0

wfail:
	echo "wakeup failed.\r\n"
	exit 1

dfail:
	echo "did not get DIAL: prompt.\r\n"
	exit 2

cfail:
	echo "no answer, busy, or timeout - can't tell which.\r\n"
	exit 3
