# Some sample entries:
# NOTE - all lines must have at least 5 fields 
#    use '-' for unused fields
# The Devices file is used in conjuction with the Dialers file.
# Types that appear in the 5th field must be either built-in
#  functions (801, Sytek, TCP, Unetserver, DK)
#  or standard functions whose name appears in the first
#  field in the Dialers file.
# Two escape characters may appear in this file:
# - \D which means don't translate the phone #/token
# - \T translate the phone #/token using the Dialcodes file
# Both refer to the phone number field in the Systems file (field 5)
# \D should always be used with entries in the Dialers file, since the
# Dialers file can contain a \T to expand the number if necessary.
# \T should only be used with builtin functions that require expansion
# NOTE: - if a phone number is expected and a \D or \T is not present
#	a \T is used for a builtin, and \D is used for an entry
#	referencing the Dialers file. (see examples below)
#
#
# ---Standard modem line
# ACU cul02 cua02 1200 801
# ACU contty - 1200 penril
# or
# ACU contty - 1200 penril \D
#
# ---A direct line so 'cu -lculd0' will work
# Direct culd0 - 4800 direct
#
# ---A ventel modem on a develcon switch (vent is the token given to
#	the develcon to reach the ventel modem)
# ACU culd0 - 1200 develcon vent ventel
# ACU culd0 - 1200 develcon vent ventel \D
#
# ---To reach a system on the local develcon switch
# Develcon culd0 - Any develcon \D
#
# ---Access a direct connection to a system
# systemx tty00 - Any direct
#
# where the Systems file looks like
# systemx 9600 systemx 1200 unused  "" in:-\r\d-in: nuucp word: nuucp
#	(The third field in Systems matches the first field in Devices)
#
# ---To connect to a system on the local Datakit
# DK - uucp Any DK \D
#
# ---To connect to a system on a Datakit in nj/ho
# DKho - uucp Any DK nj/ho/\D
#
# ---To use an ACU that is connected to Datakit that DK does not understand
#	how to talk to directly
# ACU - 0 Any DK vent ventel \D
#
# ---To the a dialer that the Datakit understands how to chat with
# This is a special case where the translation must be done by the
#	Devices file processing.
# ACU - 0 Any DK dial.\T
#
# NOTE: blank lines and lines that begin with a <space>, <tab>, or # are ignored
