1. ELM mail system has one main program and four utilities.
   The directory structure is:
     
 RCS -+- Makefile ... Makefile for entire ELM mail system
      |- README   ... this file
      |- bin      ... directory for executable command
      |- src      ... contain all source files of elm mailer
      |- hdrs     ... contain all header files used elm and utilities
      |- utils    ... contain source files of utilities
      |- man      ... contain manpages of elm and utilities
      +- lib      ... contain help files and elmrc file template.


( 'elm mailer' is '/usr/bin/elm' and 'utilities' are '/usr/bin/elmalias'
  '/usr/bin/mailfrom', '/usr/bin/newmail', '/usr/bin/readmail' )

The Makefile has following entries.

all: This compiles all sources which live in './src' and './utils'.
     This executes Makefile in './src' and './utils' directory.
     Executable objects are put into './bin' directory.

elm: This compiles elm program only. This means executing 
     Makefile in './src' directory.

utils: This compiles utility programs only. This means executing
       Makefile in './utils' directory.

install: This compiles all sources and install the command and
         manpage into right directory.

uninstall: This removes all installed files.

source: This is for installation by a media.
        If you use this entry, you must define 'TAPE' 
	variable in Makefile.

lint: This is for lint output.

clean: This removes compiles objects '*.o' and './bin/*' files.

Makefile for PFA is also existing. The file name is 'Make_pfa' 
and this residents in both 'src' and 'utils' directory.


2. Location of programs.

ELM programs must to be placed in following directory.

	elm  		- /usr/bin
	elmalias 	- /usr/bin
	mailfrom 	- /usr/bin
	newmail 	- /usr/bin
	readmail 	- /usr/bin

'elm' must have group 'mail' and mode '2755'.
Help files  and 'elmrc' template file must be in:

	elm-help.0(command help file)	- /usr/lib/elm
	elm-help.1(alias help file)	- /usr/lib/elm
	elm-help.2(option help file)	- /usr/lib/elm
	elmrc-info(elmrc file template)	- /usr/lib/elm

Manpages location for elm, elmalias, mailfrom, newmail, readmail:

	/usr/man/man1

The file src/encode.c has been moved underneath the crypt
subdirectory in the Shared Source.  To build the elm source
without CRYPT, an empty encode.c file should suffice.
