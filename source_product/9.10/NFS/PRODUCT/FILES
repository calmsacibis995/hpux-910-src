	Descriptions of user-contributed files in /nfs/bin

in, out, unout
	Front-end scripts for checkin/checkout/uncheckout.  These will
	prepend the path through your development enviroment onto the
	file names supplied, and invoke checkin, checkout or uncheckout.

sdiff
	Front-end for sccsdiff.  Like in, out, and unout , sdiff takes a
	list of files in the current directory and prepends the proper
	path information to /nfs/sccs/..../s.FILE and then does the
	diff.  These are to keep you from having to type long path
	names; not an issue if you love to type...

install
	Sun compatible install program; install is used by Sun Makefiles
	to put source code in the desired destination with the desired
	user, group and mode bits.  Note that /nfs/bin must be before
	/etc in your $PATH for the Makefile to get the right version!
	The latest version looks in your environment for $INSTALL_OPTS,
	and uses those as options to install; this is especially useful
	to apply the "-c" option (copy, don't move) to all installs.

maketd
	This script goes takes all the C source and header files named
	on the command line and determines which header files they
	include.  It is used by the "depend" target in the Makefiles to
	make the dependency lists used to create new executables when a
	header file changes.

Make_install
	This script is similar to the other Make_* scripts, but it makes
	the install target in the Makefiles.  This will actually call
	the Make_cmd script with an argument of "install".
