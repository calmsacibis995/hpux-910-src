#	Make_cmd800	--	make the s800 commands
# Written for NFS project by Cristina Mahon
# This scripts makes all the commands for the 800 in the development 
# environment.  It is invoked from an 800 but leaves the files on the 300.
# It first makes the libraries.

# $Nfs is set by the script on the s800.  If $Nfs changes on the local
# system that scripts needs to change.  That script is currently under
# /user/chm/bin/init_make.  Also Make_cmd800 needs to be invoked with
# an argument.  No argument will not produce the same effect as "all"
# because of some problem in invoking Makefiles through the MAKE script.
