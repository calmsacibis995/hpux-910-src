#	Make_kernel	--	first phase of the kernel build
# Written by Darren D. Smith for NFS project

# This script is actually the overnight kernel build process.
# Essentially, it gets the latest everything, and puts it in $nfs/kernel/300
#
# The essentially plan is:
#
# 	1) Get the latest versions of all the sources, saving the previous
#		nights versions into a SAVEDIR (see get_kernel)
#	2) Touch all special remote RCS files whose remote target has
#		been modified (just for curtesy, should not be needed really).
#		This is done by the checkdate program.   See bin/checkdate.src
#		for how this is done.
#	3) Build a cscope of all the latest files.
#
#  	NOTE: Also used to do the following, but this was moved into a
#		seperate script:
#
#	4) Get the latest object code and kernel built by the Peking group
#		This was saved until last to get as much done as possible
#		before waiting for them to get done.

# NOTE: In the overnight script that runs Make_kernel nfs has been set to $Nfs
#
get_kernel >$nfs/log/get_kernel 2>&1

# Make the configurable version of the nfs stuff for kernel
# NOTE: make_nfsklib now pushes the latest build to other machines...
#
make_nfsklib >$nfs/log/make_nfsklib 2>&1

# NOTE: if someone runs this from their local directory, they wont
# have RCS files.

# make the cscope file
