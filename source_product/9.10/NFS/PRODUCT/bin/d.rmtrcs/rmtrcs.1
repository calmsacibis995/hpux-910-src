.SH NAME
rmtrcs \- remote Revision Control System (RCS)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rmtrcs
[
.B \-n
] [
.B \-v
] rcscmd [ rcsoptions ] file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rmtrcs
is a local host front-end command processor that gives access to
Revision Control System (RCS) commands and files on a remote system.
See
.IR rcsintro (1)
for an introduction to RCS.  For most RCS commands,
if the RCS file is omitted on the command line,
or specified without a path, the
RCS command looks for the RCS file in the directory ./RCS.
Analogously,
.I rmtrcs
looks for the RCS file in the directory ./RMTRCS.  However,
for
.I rmtrcs,
the file ./RMTRCS is not a directory.
On a Vax, the file ./RMTRCS
must be a symbolic link to the RCS directory
on a remote system.
The contents of the symbolic link must be of the form
<remote-hostname>:<remote-RCS-directory>.  For example,
the following command would create such a link.
.sp
	/bin/ln -s hpda:/usr/src/bin/RCS ./RMTRCS
.sp
On HP-UX, ./RMTRCS
must be a normal file. 
The contents of the file must also be of the form
<remote-hostname>:<remote-RCS-directory>.  
The following command would create such a file.
.sp
	/bin/echo hpda:/usr/src/bin/RCS >./RMTRCS
.LP
.I Rmtrcs
performs several checks before executing the RCS
command on the remote system.
If any of the following conditions are true,
.I rmtrcs
will
.B NOT
execute the command on the remote system,
but instead, will execute the command, as it is, on the
local host.
.sp
.nf
	1) There is no ./RMTRCS file.
	2) The ./RMTRCS file is not a symbolic link.
	3) The symbolic link cannot be read.
	4) The contents of the symbolic link are
	   not of the proper format.
.sp
.fi
On HP-UX, 
.I rmtrcs 
checks for a normal file, rather than a symbolic link,
in conditions 2 - 4.
.LP
Of the three ways of specifying a pair of an RCS file
and a working file,
.I rmtrcs
only accepts the third form, in which only the working
file is specified.
.LP
.I Rcscmd,
in the synopsis above, is one of the following
RCS or Azure RCS commands.
Special nuances of each command are noted below.
.TP
ci
Execute
.IR ci (1)
on the remote system.
Because
.I rmtrcs
cannot detect the success or failure of a remote
.I ci
command, it renames all check-in source files to have
the .RBK extension.  Because
.I rmtrcs
does not necessarily know what the resulting revision number
will be, 
.I rmtrcs
cannot display the resulting revision number
before prompting for the log message, itself.
For creating initial branch revisions, that do not differ
from the associated trunk revision, use the -f option to
.I ci,
to forcibly create the revision.  Otherwise,
.I ci
on the remote system, will
.B NOT
create the branch revision,
because it is the same as the trunk revision.
.TP
co
Execute
.IR co (1)
on the remote system.
.I Rmtrcs
will never produce a zero length file as the result of
a check-out operation.
.TP
rcs
Execute
.IR rcs (1)
on the remote system.
.TP
rcsdiff
Execute
.IR rcsdiff (1)
on the remote system.
.TP
rlog
.br
Execute
.IR rlog (1)
on the remote system.
.TP
locks
Execute the Azure RCS command
.IR locks (1)
on the remote system.
.I Locks
identifies all revisions of a file that are locked.
Note that
.I locks
actually accepts the names of RCS files (not working files)
or directories.  Typically the directory . is specified
with this command.
.TP
markbr
Execute the Azure RCS command
.IR markbr(1)
on the remote system.
.I Markbr
associates a symbolic name with the current branch
number(s) of the file(s).
.TP
markrev
Execute the Azure RCS command
.IR markrev (1)
on the remote system.
.I Markrev
associates a symbolic name with the current revision
number(s) of the file(s).
.TP
rcscheck
Execute the Azure RCS command
.IR rcscheck(1)
on the remote system.
.I Rcscheck
checks the file(s) to see it is(they are)
up-to-date with respect to the revision(s) at the head
of the trunk.
.LP
.I Rcsoptions,
in the synopsis above,
are any of the options accepted by the RCS or Azure RCS
commands supported by
.I rmtrcs.
The
.I files
specified are the working files on which the RCS or
Azure RCS commands operate.
Syntactically speaking, everything to the right of
.I rcscmd,
inclusive, may be thought of as normal RCS or Azure RCS command.
Since
.I rmtrcs
will execute the RCS or Azure RCS command locally
if it cannot properly access the file ./RMTRCS, it is safe to use
.I rmtrcs
for all local RCS operations,
instead of calling the appropriate RCS or Azure RCS command
directly.  For those who use
.IR csh (1)
the following aliases would be appropriate.
.sp
.nf
	alias ci       "rmtrcs ci"
	alias co       "rmtrcs co"
	alias rcs      "rmtrcs rcs"
	alias rcsdiff  "rmtrcs rcsdiff"
	alias rlog     "rmtrcs rlog"
	alias locks    "rmtrcs locks"
	alias markbr   "rmtrcs markbr"
	alias markrev  "rmtrcs markrev"
	alias rcscheck "rmtrcs rcscheck"
.fi
.LP
.I Rmtrcs
takes a few options itself, which are interpreted
as follows.
.TP
.B \-n
Trace and print, but
.B DO
.B NOT
execute the calls needed to perform the RCS operation.
.TP
.B \-v
Trace and print the calls needed to perform the
RCS operation as they are executed.
.SH FILES
/tmp/rmtdir<uid>	directory for temporary files
*.RBK			\fIrmtrcs ci\fP back-up files
.SH "SEE ALSO"
ci(1), co(1), rcs(1), rcsdiff(1), rcsintro(1), rlog(1)
and locks(1), markbr(1), markrev(1), rcscheck(1).
.SH BUGS
This program is a real hack, and as such, the author
disavows any knowledge of origin.
.LP
Currently,
.I rmtrcs
does not support the
.I ci
-t option.
