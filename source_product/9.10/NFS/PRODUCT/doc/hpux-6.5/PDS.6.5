 DESCRIPTION

 Provide Sun Microsystems' Network File System version 3.2 (NFS/3.2) on the
 HP9000 Series 300 HP-UX system.  With NFS, heterogeneous systems on a common
 network can transparently share files.  Enhancements provided in Sun's 
 NFS/3.2 include remote file locking, a remote execution service, and an RPC
 protocol compiler.

 Dave Matthews' NFS development group will have primary responsibility for
 the enhancements to NFS.  Glen Foster's project team will be responsible for
 regression and reliability tests.  USO is providing consulting to incorporate
 NFS kernel modifications.  The NFS code is being ported from source code
 provided by Sun.

 MARKET CONTRIBUTION
 
 Sun has established NFS as an emerging industry standard.  Customers now 
 expect the additional features provided in NFS version 3.2.  The Lock Manager
 provides System V compatible file and record locking for both local and remote
 files.  The RPC protocol compiler, rpcgen, introduces a language for creating
 RPC servers and XDR routines without having to write C routines.  REX provides
 remote execution, including interactive commands, while preserving the working
 directory and environment variables of the invoking process.

 KEY PROJECT "MUST" OBJECTIVES
 
 Port Sun's NFS/3.2 to the Series 300/800 HP-UX system.  Enhancements include
 remote file locking, a remote execution service, an RPC protocol compiler,
 and support for named pipes over NFS.

 Provide the same connectivity with 6.5 as HP-UX 6.0.

 Release the series 300/800 NFS 3.2 concurrently.
