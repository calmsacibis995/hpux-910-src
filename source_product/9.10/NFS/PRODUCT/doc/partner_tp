\fIA basic set of tests will be performed after installation\fR.
These tests will be run on the machines labelled 2dae1 and dae2 as
seen in the NFS project configuration matrix.
.sp
.AL 1 9
.LI "___~" 1
(\fBDAE\fR)
Verify that all filesets install successfully from the medium; perform a
checksum on the installed bits to validate them.
.LI "___~" 1
(\fBDAE\fR)
Verify that all files in every fileset are present with the
correct modes, owners and groups.
.LI "___~" 1
(\fBNFS team - 6 engineers\fR)
Product functionality will be exercised regularly by
self-hosting on our home machine (2dae1).
.LI "___~" 1
(\fBDAE, DDS\fR)
Check files in /etc/filesets - no user configurable files
should be included.
Should verify after update, after conversion of standalone system
to diskless, and after having added a cnode.
.LI "___~" 1
(\fBDAE, DDS\fR)
Verify output from customize and CDFcustomize scripts in
/tmp/update.log and /tmp/reconfig.log.
Should verify after update, after conversion of standalone system
to diskless, and after having added a cnode.
.LI "___~" 1
(\fBDAE, DDS\fR)
Verify CDFs in the file system.
Check for correct contexts after update, conversion of standalone
system to diskless, and after having added a cnode.
.PF "''-~\\\\nP~-''"
.LI "___~" 1
(\fBDAE, DDS\fR)
Verify the owner, group and permission bits of CDFs and their elements.
.LI "___~" 1
(\fBDAE\fR)
After updating, each customize belonging to the product being
tested is re-executed and the results verified (no extraneous
errors, no corruption of the system):
.sp
.nf
	cd /
	system/<fileset>/customize
.fi
.LI "___~" 1
(\fBDAE\fR)
The following actions will be taken on the systems.
.AL 1 9 1
.LI
Login (any login shell desired)
.LI
ps -el
.LI
mkdir /tmp/config
.LI
/bin/ls -l / > /tmp/config/root.list
.LI
cd /tmp/config
.LI
pwd
.LI
cp root.list remove.me
.LI
df -t
.LI
cd /
.LI
rm -rf /tmp/config
.LI
shutdown
.LI
use vi
.LI
build a kernel via reconfig or by using the config(1m) command
.LI
reboot
.LI
Repeat steps 1 and 2.

\fIA full battery of tests will be applied to the NFS bits by the NFS Testing
Team.\fR
These tests will be run among the machines labelled 2jlv5 through 2jlv19 as
seen in the LAN project configuration matrix (which specific ones is, as yet,
unknown).
