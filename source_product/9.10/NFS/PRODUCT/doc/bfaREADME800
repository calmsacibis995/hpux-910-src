Following is a list of steps to go through to install bfa commands on two 
machines and to install the scaffold. This document was created on the 
fly and not intended as a complete guide. Also, if you change the process
please update this document.

1) run $nfs/bin/bfatrans800 to transfer commands and kernel to machines
ex.	! $nfs/bin/bfatrans800 machine1 -bfa >& errs &
ex.     ! $nfs/bin/bfatrans800 machine2 -bfa >& errs &

2) Merge the BFAed version of libc.a and libbfa.a. All files needed to
   do this are created on the bfa machines by bfatrans800. Log onto each
   of the remote machines and do the following.

   a) cd /tmp
   b) chmod +x bfalibmerg
   c) bfalibmerg
   d) rm bfalibmerg
   e) rm libbfa.a

3) copy scaffold from hpcndm to scaffold directory.  
ex.	rcp -r /scaf/ADMIN hostname:/users/scaf
	rcp -r /scaf/nfs hostname:/users/scaf

4) Make sure bfa is installed on the machines.
   a) check to see if the following files exist on the machine:
       /usr/local/bin/bfa
       /usr/local/bin/bfacc 
       /usr/lib/libbfa.a
    b) if they do not exist copy them to the machine:
        rcp /usr/local/bin/bfa hostname:/usr/local/bin/bfa
        rcp /usr/local/bin/bfacc hostname:/usr/local/bin/bfacc
        rcp /usr/local/lib/libbfa.a hostname:/usr/local/lib/libbfa.a

5) go to machine with scaffold on it, log in as root (csh)
	setenv SCAFFOLD /users/scaf   		-these values can be found
	setenv ROOTDIR /users/rootdir		-in .profile in nfsbb's 
	setenv SCAFOWN scafadm			-account 
	cd /users/scaf/ADMIN/TOOLS.SRC
	make all >& errs &
	cd .. 
	build_skel -o scafadm >& errs &
	mkdir /users/scaf/GOOD /users/scaf/BAD 
		/users/scaf/RESULTS /users/scaf/DOC
	install_mod -xbfa nfs >& errs &

6) run tests.  run yp tests with one machine as client and 
	another machine as server.

9) run $nfs/bin/bfamerge800 to merge databases from both machines.  
ex.	$nfs/bin/bfamerge800 machine1 machine2 

7) run $nfs/bin/bfasum800 to create report
ex.    $nfs/bin/bfasum800

8) look at results
	cat bfaout
	cat list_byBFA
