.H 2 "Automount Notes"

   This section provides some general information about automount and
some of its related files.  For instance it is worth mentioning how automount
is started through /etc/netnfsrc2 and how it fits into the diskless cluster
environment.

.H 2 "Automount and Diskless"

     Automount is a CDF as are all program files that can exist in a 
heterogeneous cluster environment.  There should only be one automount
daemon running on each cluster.  When automount calls vfsmount to let
the kernel know that it is the NFS server for the corresponding mount
point, it gives the kernel the loop back IP address of the node it
is running on.  When any node in the cluster accesses an automount
mount point that IP address is used to contact the automount daemon.
Automount originally used the loop back address 127.0.0.1 for 
communications with automount.  That does not work in a cluster environment
since automount is not running on each cluster node.

.H 2 "Automount Invocation"

     Here is the section from /etc/netnfsrc2 that starts automount taking
into consideration the issue of diskless.

##
# Start the automount daemon with the mount points specified in the
# auto.master NIS map.  If NIS is not running or the auto.master map
# is not available, automount will exit silently.  Note that this is
# done only on standalone systems and diskless root servers.
