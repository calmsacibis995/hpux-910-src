.H 2 "The Automount Source Files"

.nf
nfs_prot.x	Contains the rpc language specifying the nfs protocol.
		The files nfs_prot.c and nfs_prot.h are generated from
		this file. 

nfs_prot.c      These are the xdr functions generated by rpcgen from the
		nfs_prot.x file.

nfs_prot.h      This is the header file generated by rpcgen from the nfs_prot.x
		file.

automount.h	The automounter's private header file.  Defines data structures
		used internally by the automounter.

nfs.h		Is this file really necessary?

auto_main.c	The main function for the automounter.  Also contains the
		auto_run function that is used in place of the RPC svc_run
		funtion.  Other support functions for main also reside here.

auto_mount.c    Contains the functions for and related to mounting and 
		unmounting NFS file systems.

auto_proc.c	These are all of the NFSPROC_* functions that can be invoked
		by an NFS client.

nfs_cast.c 	This file has the nfs_cast function that is used to broadcast 
		to a specific group of NFS servers.

nfs_server.c    The NFS daemon rpc program that the automounter is emulating.

auto_all.c	Has some miscellaneous functions.

nfs_trace.c	Trace routines for all of the automounter data structure types.

auto_look.c	Contains the lookup function that searches the automounter
		queues for the specified directory.  Other similar and/or
		related lookup functions.

many_cast.c	This file has the many_cast function that is used to broadcast 
		to a specific group of hosts.

auto_node.c	This file mainly contains functions for manipulating the
		internal data structures. (getting and freeing vnode and
		directory entries etc.

auto_site.c	This is an empty file and I don't know why it is here. 

putenv.c	Contains local version of putenv(3c) that adds/replaces
		environment variables.

strdup.c        Contains the strdup function that given a string duplicates 
		that string.
