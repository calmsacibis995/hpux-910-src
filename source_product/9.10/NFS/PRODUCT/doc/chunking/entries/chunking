.xx "WHAT" 1
Maintain a list of projects for the group to work on a "chunk" at a
time;  things that should be done but usually get put aside for higher 
priority activities.
.xx "MOTIVATION" 2
Continually finding things that could be fixed but we never
get the time.
.sp
Too many conversations that end "why can't we do this better"
and "there's got to be a better way".
.xx EFFECT 2
Have a group mechanism to get certain tasks done 
.sp
Completing "passed over" items
.sp
Catching things that may slip through the cracks and be forgotten
.sp
Better code for customer.

.xx IMPLEMENTATION 0
The team chunking coordinator keeps lists of active and proposed chunks.
This is reviewed monthly at the last team meeting of the month
to get status updates and
decide what should be done during the next month.  New ideas are added
to the list and prioritized.  Volunteers are
usually taken for tasks, depending on interest, background and time
available.  Chunking coordinator creates a "task sheet" for new tasks, 
and records of finished
projects are kept in a notebook to track all the activities and results.
.sp
Types of chunking items include: fixing broken things, developing new
processes, organizing group standards, tying up loose ends.
Areas of chunking items include: missing code features,
test technology, testing processes, processes for interacting with other
groups,  development environment and processes, general team processes,
system admin., and any other area we spend a significant amount of time 
on.
Items are large and small; any area that needs attention can be put
on the list.
.sp
Once an item is on the list and volunteers are assigned, the volunteers work
out with the project manager time to be spent on a given task.
.xx EFFORT 2   
Chunking coordinator: writing up reports and keeping current list
of activities - 1 hr/week.
.sp
Others spend time doing chunking activities; this is reflected in
the individual reports and allocated in monthly objectives.
.xx "LIMITATIONS" 2
The list of proposed activities grows much faster than the capacity to
work on different items.
.sp
Chunking activities don't get done during hectic times.
.xx "INSIGHTS" 2
This provides a very useful process for dealing with things that don't have
to be fixed, but it's better if they were.  It acts as a group 
"grass catcher" list.
.xx "FUTURE WORK" 2
Continue to use the process and dedicate time to these tasks.
.sp
Refine the process to add minimal overhead cost.
