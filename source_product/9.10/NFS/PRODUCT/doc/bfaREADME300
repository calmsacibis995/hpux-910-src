Following is a list of steps to go through to install bfa commands on two 
machines and to install the scaffold. This document was created on the 
fly and not intended as a complete guide. Also, if you change the process
please update this document.

1) run $nfs/bin/bfatrans to transfer commands and kernel to machines
ex.	! $nfs/bin/bfatrans machine1 -bfa >& errs &
ex.     ! $nfs/bin/bfatrans machine2 -bfa >& errs &

2) run $nfs/bin/bfa_libc to build a libc that includes library routines
built with bfa.
ex.	$nfs/bin/bfa_libc /tmp/libc.bfa >& errs &

3) run $nfs/bin/headtrans to copy latest version of header files to machine
that will have the scaffold on it.
ex.	$nfs/bin/headtrans hostname >& errs &

4) copy new libc to machine that will have the scaffold on it
ex.	! rcp /tmp/libc.bfa hostname:/lib/libc.a

5) copy scaffold from hpcndm to scaffold directory.  
ex.	rcp -r /scaf/ADMIN hostname:/users/scaf
	rcp -r /scaf/nfs hostname:/users/scaf

6) Make sure bfa is installed on the machines.
   a) check to see if the following files exist on the machine:
       /usr/local/bin/bfa
       /usr/local/bin/bfacc 
       /usr/lib/libbfa.a
    b) if they do not exist copy them to the machine:
        rcp /usr/local/bin/bfa hostname:/usr/local/bin/bfa
        rcp /usr/local/bin/bfacc hostname:/usr/local/bin/bfacc
        rcp /usr/local/lib/libbfa.a hostname:/usr/local/lib/libbfa.a

7) go to machine with scaffold on it, log in as root (csh)
	setenv SCAFFOLD /users/scaf   		-these values can be found
	setenv ROOTDIR /users/rootdir		-in .profile in nfsbb's 
	setenv SCAFOWN scafadm			-account 
	cd /users/scaf/ADMIN/TOOLS.SRC
	make all >& errs &
	cd .. 
	build_skel -o scafadm >& errs &
	mkdir /users/scaf/GOOD /users/scaf/BAD 
		/users/scaf/RESULTS /users/scaf/DOC
	install_mod -xbfa nfs >& errs &

8) run tests.  run yp tests with one machine as client and 
	another machine as server.

9) run $nfs/bin/bfamerge300 to merge databases from both machines.  
ex.	$nfs/bin/bfamerge300 machine1 machine2

10) run $nfs/bin/bfasum300 to create report
ex.	$nfs/bin/bfasum300

11) look at results
	cat bfaout
	cat list_byBFA
