This document is designed to be a source of information for anyone providing 
localization support for the NFS product.  It contains a brief description of 
the level of localization of the NFS Services product.
It also contains a list of all the messages that are part of the NFS message
catalogs and their explanations.  That list is the most useful portion of
the document for those that do not have direct access to the code, but are
translating the message catalogs.

.H 1 "LOCALIZATION OVERVIEW"
.sp 2
.ad
NFS provides a means of transparently sharing files among heterogeneous 
systems on a common network.  Remote  file  access remains invisible to users.
The manual pages and External Reference Specifications for NFS are available
upon request.
.sp
According to the MUST objective described in the PRD for the NFS
project we support the HP-15 Standard.  
The following features of Native Language Support (NLS) are supported:
.ML o
.LI
Filename support:
.DL 
.LI
We support 8-bit filenames
.LI
We do not support all possible 16 bit filenames, since they are not fully
supported by the HP-UX kernel.  However, some 16 bit filenames may
work, depending on the characters making up the filename.
Refer to the design limitations item for a more detailed explanation.
.LE
.LI
Support for message catalogues:
.sp
All NFS user level commands have been changed to support
message catalogs.  
.LI
Support for local customs:
.sp
We modified messages to support local customs
like formats for numbers, dates, times, etc.
.LI
Support eight and sixteen bit characters:
.sp
NFS is able to send across the network eight and sixteen bit characters,
according to the testing we have done.
.LI
HP-15 Standard design limitations:
.sp
.DL 
.LI
A  design  flaw  exists  in  the  current  HP-15  
Standard.  The Standard  restricts  computer  systems  
on the same  network  to support the same 16-bit  
character  set.  The existing  uucp and LAN products 
are in violation of this restriction.  There will be no
attempt in this project to rectify the problem.
.LI
Full support for 16-bit filenames is not incorporated in the HP-UX
kernel, but many 16-bit filenames will be correctly interpreted. 
Problems occur if one of the 16-bit characters in the filename happens to have
as a second byte the byte value equal to "/". In that case the HP-UX kernel 
will not correctly interpret the 16-bit character because it will see the "/".
Taiwanese is an example of a 2-byte language that defines "/" as the
second of a 2-byte character.
.LE
.LE
.sp 2
However, we do have limitations in terms of what we type of localization work 
we could do with the available tools.  Below is a list of the limitations for
the NFS user level commands.  NFS commands not listed support
8 and 16-bit characters, message catalogs, local customs, 8-bit
filenames as needed.  16-bit filenames are supported to the extent
that the underlying HP-UX kernel supports them.  A description of the NLS 
capabilities is available under the International Support section of the brick 
pages for each NFS command affected by NFS.

Commands            Limitations
.sp
domainname      |  Domainname is limited on its choice of 16-bit domain
                |  names by which 16-bit file names HP-UX can support.  
                |  The reason behind this is that the domain name gets 
                |  translated into a directory name used by YP to store
                |  the YP database maps.
                |
yppasswd        |  Non-ascii characters are not allowed in /etc/passwd.
                |  So even if yppasswd does not have any inherent 
                |  problems with 8 or 16-bit characters, they cannot be
                |  used for the password map.
                |
rpc.ypasswdd    |  Same comment as yppasswd.
                |
ypmake          |  This is a shell script, so it does not support 
                |  message catalogs.  Right now there is no way defined
                |  to provide the same sort of message catalog support 
                |  for shell scripts.  Currently the shell scripts would
                |  have to be modified by the end user or be different 
                |  for different languages.
                |
ypxfr_2perda    |  Same comment as ypmake.
ypxfr_1perda    |  Same comment as ypmake.
ypxfr_1perh     |  Same comment as ypmake.
vhe_altlog	|  Same comment as ypmake.
vhe_getlist	|  Same comment as ypmake.
vhe_mounter	|  Same comment as ypmake.
                |
pcnfsd          |  Pcnfsd does not support 8 or 16-bit characters.  It 
                |  modifies the high 8th bit of some of the information
                |  it receives for encryption purposes.  However, since 
                |  PC-NFS is not an HP-UX product and we have no control 
                |  over how 8 and 16-bit characters are sent to us from a 
                |  PC, this is not considered to be a major problem.

All the changes described above have been implemented.  The next step
to localize NFS is to translate the message catalogs.  The next section

	This message is printed if anything is wrong with the syntax of
	the rpcgen command line.

4 %1$s: output would overwrite %2$s\n
	If the name of the output file is the same as the input file, the
	input file could get overwritten.  So this message is given instead
	of doing the overwrite.

5 %s: unable to open 
	If rpcgen cannot open an output file, this message is printed.

21 definition keyword expected
	In the text given to rpcgen, there was a word that was seen that
	was not a keyword (const, struct, enum, union, typedef or program)
	when such a keyword was expected.

22 illegal result type
	This message is printed if a program definition in the input file
	to rpcgen is declared to return a result of type "opaque".

23 illegal argument type
	This message is printed if a program definition in the input file
	to rpcgen is declared to accept an argument of type "opaque".

24 no array-of-pointer declarations -- use typedef
25 no array-of-pointer declarations -- use typedef
	An array of pointers cannot be declared in rpcgen (int *ptrs[10]).
	To get the desired result, one must declare a typedef of a pointer
	type (typedef int * intptr) and then have an array of those
	(intptr ptrs[10])

26 array declaration expected
	An object declared to be of type opaque must be an fixed or
	variable-length array.

27 variable-length array declaration expected
	An object declared to be of type opaque must be an fixed or
	variable-length array.

28 voids allowed only inside union and program definitions
	If the word "void" is seen in any context besides inside a union
	or a program definition, this message is printed.

29 expected type specifier
	Declaring a data item in rpcgen is like declaring one in the C
	language.  Rpcgen expects to see a data-type followed by the data-item.
	(int x;).  If there is no data-type seen, (== x;), then this message
	is printed.

30 only simple declaration allowed in switch
	An array is not allowed as the controling variable in the switch
	portion of the union declaration.  If one is seen by rpcgen, this
	message is printed.

41 constant or identifier expected
	In many places in rpcgen input, rpcgen will expect to see a constant.
	For example, in a program declaration, the program needs to be given
	a program number.  This is done with a constant.  This message is 
	printed if it is missing.

42 (NLS) illegal second byte in 16-bit character
	Based on the language environment variable, the second byte
	of a two-byte character was not a legal bit pattern for that language.

43 illegal character in file: 
	Some charater (such as a control character) was found in the
	input to rpcgen which causes this message to be printed.

44 (NLS) illegal second byte in 16-bit character
	Based on the language environment variable, the second byte
	of a two-byte character was a not legal bit pattern for that language.

45 unterminated string constant
	A string constant was missing a terminating quote character.

46 illegal character constant
47 illegal character constant
48 illegal character constant
49 illegal character constant
50 illegal character constant
51 illegal character constant
	Rpcgen allows the use of character constants (\014) in its
	input.  A badly form constant (\bad) was seen by rpcgen and
	caused this message to be printed.

52 preprocessor error
        If during the execution of the C-preprocessor on the input source
	to rpcgen an error happens, this message is printed.

53 (NLS) illegal second byte in 16-bit character
	Based on the language environment variable, the second byte
	of a two-byte character was a not legal bit pattern for that language.

54 preprocessor error
        If during the execution of the C-preprocessor on the input source
	to rpcgen an error happens, this message is printed.

61 %1$s, line %2$d: 
	This is the format of the error messages caused by syntax errors in
	the input to rpcgen.  The %1$s is the name of the input file.
	The %2$d is the number of the line in the input file that had
	the syntax error.

62 %s\n
	This is the format string used to print out the text of an 
	error message.

63 too many files!\n
	If rpcgen cannot open an output file because there are already too
	many open files, this message is printed.

64 expected '%s'
65 expected '%s' or '%s'
66 expected '%s', '%s' or '%s'
	These three strings are related.  In the parsing of the input to
	rpcgen, there will be situations where a certain input is expected.
	If this proper input is not given, one of these messages is printed.
	If there is only one type of input that is expected, the first
	message is printed.  If the expected input could be one of two
	cases, the second message is printed.  Finally the last message
	is printed if the expected input could be one of three
	cases.
