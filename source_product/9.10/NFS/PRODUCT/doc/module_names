#	   @(#)$Revision: 1.21.109.1 $	$Date: 91/11/19 14:29:07 $
# 	Because of the change to SEIS to obtain project metrics, there has
# 	been a change to the module names that should be used to put in the
#	fixed module field when resolving a DTS report.
#	The following are module names that should be used:

	nfscmds  (DTS Project Name)
	   rpc		(User space rpc, rpclib, rpcsvclib defects)
	   yp		(Any Yellow Pages defects)
	   nfs		(Defects relating to NFS that are found in user
			 space code, lockd, statd or nfsd)
	   rex		(Any rex defects)
	   util		(Defects in the commands of the nfs product, rpcgen,
			 showmount, rpc.mountd, spray)
	   other	(Anything else that won't fit in the names above such
			 as a documentation defect)
 	nfs300   (DTS Project Name)
	   rpc      	(Kernel rpc defects)
	   nfs		(Any non NFS3.2 kernel nfs defects)
	   nfs3_2	(Any NFS3.2 related kernel nfs defects, lockf or 
			 nfs device files)
	   other	(Anything else that won't fit in the names above)

# If more specificity is required, it can be used, but the more specific
# module names need to be added to either the /usr/DTS/SEIS/nfscmds or
# /usr/DTS/SEIS/nfs300 files.  These files map the more specific name
# to a name that SEIS understands.
