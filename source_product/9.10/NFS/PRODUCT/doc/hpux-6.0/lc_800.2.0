This document contains the NFS/800 program milestones and the
corresponding deliverables and dependencies.  
The target dates for the milestones are based on the HP-UX program 
2.0 release integration cycles. 
.sp
The two major objectives of this document are to provide logical 
checkpoints based on the individual CND project team schedules
and to centralize a list of major dependencies which the involved project
teams have on each other or on external entities.  
.sp
This document is a working document used by the CND NFS/800 groups.  
The deliverables listed for each checkpoint are specified for 
these groups, with other external projects covered under dependencies.
.sp
The deliverables are divided into 2.0 milestone deliverables 
and internal deliverables.  The 2.0 milestone deliverables are the ones 
of interest to the 2.0 program and are subject to the change control team 
review process, while the internal deliverables are specific to CND and 
are managed by the different projects involved on the NFS/800 at CND.
.sp 
ASSUMPTION:  The NFS 300 and NFS 800 products, including product structures,
will be nearly identical.
.sp
If the above assumption does not hold, the documentation schedule
will be seriously affected.

.H 1 "PROJECT OBJECTIVES"
.sp 2
.ad
The s800 NFS project is responsible for providing Sun's Network File
System  (NFS) on the HP 9000  Series  800  HP-UX  systems.  NFS
provides a means of transparently sharing  files among heterogeneous
systems on a common network.  Remote  file  access remains invisible
to users.
.sp
The NFS  code  will be  ported  from  source  code  provided  by Sun
Microsystems,   Inc.  in  accordance   with  Sun's  NFS   technology
licensing  agreement.  To insure compatibility and connectivity in a
multi-vendor network environment, the HP NFS product will conform to
the  multi-vendor  industry standards   implemented  by  Sun.  These
standards are defined by the NFS protocol specifications.
.sp 
For more detail on the NFS/800 project objectives please refer to the 
Product Requirements Document.

.H 1 "GENERAL DEPENDENCIES"
.ad
.sp
This section lists general dependencies the CND lab groups have on
different partners.   Listed below are the dependencies, which
groups have to meet those dependencies and a brief explanation of 
what they consist of:
.sp
.AL
.LI
Participation on the SWAT team. 
A member each of the v-node, azure, sapphire and net_kern groups should be
part of the SWAT team.  The SWAT representative can be either always the same
person or different people on a rotational schedule.
The SWAT team is called when there is a major defect that is stopping any
further testing.  The resolution of the defect that caused the SWAT team to
be called becomes the main task of all members of the team until that defect
is fixed.  Based on the "contract" that Steve Kusmer wrote in March 1987,
upon a request for help an engineer will be assigned whose primary task
is to solve the problem.
.LI
An available kernel once a week.
The v-node, azure and net_kern groups will put together a kernel once a week.
This kernel will be tested using ISO's and IND's regression suites.  The
group responsible for doing the final tests before the kernel is made
available to us will also run the CND quicky NFS tests.
.LI
Commands available before integration cycles.
Sapphire will provide commands according to the internal ISO kernel
integration milestones listed at the end of this section.
.LI
Internet available when needed.
Most of the processes implemented between CND and ISO/IND rely on the Internet. 
If the Internet is not up the turn-around for some of our deliverables will
jump from an hour or two to a day or more.  This will become specially
critical when the integration cycles begin.
.LI
Each group that develops NFS tests will write those tests so that they fit
into the "ING" common tests scaffold.  They will also provide those tests
to the CND testing group.  The testing group will merge them into the
overall NFS scaffold test suite.
.LE
.sp
The table below lists the ISO internal milestones.  Sapphire has agreed to
provide an update of the following commands at each one of these milestones:
.sp
.nf   
     MEA support
     SAKE requirements
     NLS date/time
     16 bit filename support
