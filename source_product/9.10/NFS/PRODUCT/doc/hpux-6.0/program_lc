  This document has two major objectives.  The first of these objectives
  is to provide logical program milestones or checkpoints.  These
  logical checkpoints are an outgrowth of each of the individual CND
  project team schedules which are involved in the series 300 6.0 release.
  The intent of these  checkpoints is to allow project and program 
  management to focus on goals which have significance for the majority
  of the program team.  The second objective of this document is to
  centralize a list of the major dependencies which the involved project
  teams have on each other or on external entities.

                            Introduction
                            
 Colorado Networking Division has recently undertaken the aggressive
 goal of completing NFS functionality and networking architecture
 convergence on the 9000/300 in time for product shipments with 
 the system 6.0 release in September of 1987.  Subsequently, four
 project teams within Jim Willits' Technical Systems Networking 
 section have been mobilized to meet these objectives.  The project
 teams are organized as follows: 
   
 Project Name    Responsibility          Project Manager   #MTS     Start Date
 
 NERFS         NFS code port and fix      Jeff Lindberg     5         8/1/86

 With the number of project teams and MTS's involved in this program
 and its accelerated schedule, it is anticipated that smooth inter and
 intra project planning and scheduling will be difficult.  The intent
 of this document is to provide major program checkpoints to which all
 involved projects can manage accordingly.  This document was derived
 from the following documents:
 
    1) Document:  Project Lifecycle for Nerfs 300 program

       Revision:  09 June 1987

 

 Since this lifecycle is intended to be a reflection and coalescence
 of the individual project lifecycles, it is anticipated that a new
 revision of this document will be built after each checkpoint.
 These updates will consist of two important elements:
 
    1) A program synopsis of the major results, concerns, and issues 
       which occurred in the last phase of the program.  The last phase of
       the program is defined as the time between the last checkpoint
       and its immediate predecessor.  It is hoped that this synopsis
       will be helpful in:
           a) creating more effective plans to meet the next checkpoint
           b) the final post mortem analysis of the project
       
       Deliverables and dependencies which are not met on the specified
       date are denoted with a series of asterisks as follows:
       
          *** items which are of high importance to the program team
              and have not shown significant progress are denoted with
              three asterisks
              
           ** items which are of high importance to the program team
              and are near completion or partially usable are denoted
              with two asterisks
       
            * items which are of some importance to the program team or
              have had "negotiated" changes based on new data are
              denoted with one asterisk
              
           
    2) Updates to the deliverables and dependencies list of the next
       checkpoint for each project team.  These updates will be based
       on new data or recent necessary changes in the individual 
       project plans.  
   
                            
 Checkpoint dates shown in this document are currently targets or goals.
 These dates will solidify as "bottoms up" schedules become available
 from the individual project groups.  The goal for finalized checkpoint
 dates and schedule commitments is February 24th (I/L checkpoint).

                            
                            
                            
                            
                     Management of Dependencies
                     

 Key project and program dependencies are listed within this document.
 These dependencies are sorted first by applicable checkpoint, then by
 the owner (or holder) of the dependency, and lastly by the time at which
 they occur.  The following process is recommended for managing the project 
 dependencies specified within this document:

   1) The owner of the dependency is the manager (and team) that the
      dependency is on.  For example if the TRANSFORMERS project needs
      functional NFS code from the NERFS team by March 1st, then the
      NERFS manager (and team) should own and manage to this dependency 
      as a deliverable to the TRANSFORMERS team.
      
   2) The dependency list should be reviewed regularly at program team
      meetings.  Major upcoming dependencies should be brought up at
      program meetings as reminders to the responsible managers.
      
   3) Dependencies which are not met become a concern for the program
      and should be worked out as quickly as possible by the 
      responsible manager (the owner) and the requesting manager.
      All dependencies which are not met will be enumerated in this
      document as the program progresses.

PROGRAM CHECKPOINT SUMMARY

Checkpoints: 
	    Code Complete
	    April 8th, 1987

	    BETA test release
	    April 30th, 1987


Program Synopsis:

	The primary objective associated with the April 8th code complete 
	checkpoint was functionally complete NFS and converged networking
	code.  A number of the checkpoint deliverables were not delivered 
	as originally planned (see below).  

	The BETA test release checkpoint (4/30) was effectively replaced 
	by the EB1 and EB2 system release checkpoints.  This replacement
	was caused by a revised HP-UX 6.0 schedule which forced a 2-1/4
	calendar month slip.  Numerous deliverables and dependencies 
	were redefined to account for the expanded project PERT.  In
	addition, project teams were de-staffed to a level commensurate
	with the remaining effort.


Issues/Concerns:

	[1]  A firm HP-UX 6.0 schedule is required from SSO in order
	     to solidify the deliverable and dependency dates in this
	     life cycle.  Until a firm schedule is obtained, it is likely
	     that this document will undergo frequent, and fairly major,
	     changes.

PROGRAM CHECKPOINT SUMMARY

Checkpoint: 
	    EARLY BIRD ONE RELEASE (EB1)
	    May 12th, 1987

Program Synopsis:

	The EB1 release represented the first formal release of partner
	subsystems to the HP-UX 6.0 SSIT process.  The HP-UX 6.0 EB1
	systems were released from SSIT on May 26th.  The EB1 system
	was given to a number of alpha-sites and to selected beta-sites 
	and business opportunities.

	As originally suspected, the EB1 release cycle revealed a number 
	of process problems.  These problems were related to subsystem
	builds, testing and delivery to SSIT.



Issues/Concerns:

	[1] The libc.a library was originally built without YP support.
	    This caused a turn of the EB1 bits after partner submittals
	    were complete.  Furthermore, rlogin and telnet services were
	    not rebuilt with the new libc and were released without the
	    necessary YP support.
