                              Introduction

The "traNsFormerS" project has the responsibility for testing NFS on the
HP 9000 series 300 computers.  The overriding objectives for this project
are to meet the product quality goals (as outlined in the NFS Product 
Requirements Document) and to meet the 6.0 300 system bit release schedule
(currently unknown).  The code porting, development, and defect 
fixing responsibilities for the NFS project are in the NerFS project group
under Jeff Lindberg.  Jeff also serves as program manager for NFS 300/800.
Other project efforts related to this project include the Peking project
for porting the 800 networking kernel to the 300 (under Dean Thompson), and
the Smelter project for testing Arpa/Berkeley and NS protocols on the 300
(under Chris Fugitt).

The intent of this document is to clarify the expectations, both internal
and external to the project group, for the different phases of the project.
These expectations are formulated as a series of project checkpoints,
project team deliverables at each checkpoint, key dependencies on other
groups, and goal dates for each checkpoint and deliverable.  The goal
dates are a reflection of the project team's current 50% schedule estimates.
These dates may need to change as key dependencies are negotiated and
planned into other project groups' schedules. 
 



 
                                Terminology


Several phrases are used within this docoment which require a clear and 
concise definition.  These key phrases and a first pass at their definitions
are as follows:

   Level A Quality System  - characterized by:
         - No "mainline" functionality system code panics
         - No more than 5 known "corner case" function system code panics
         - No more than 5 known weight 8 or above code defects 
         - final "phase 1" NFS commands (from ISO/SSO) in place

   Level B Quality System  - characterized by:
         - No more than 2 known "corner case" function system code panics
         - No more than 5 known weight 6 or above code defects 
         - 50% of final NFS commands (from ISO/SSO) in place
         - 80% of SUN NFS performance demonstratable (330-330)
        
   Level C Quality System  - characterized by: 
         - No unresolved defects of weight 6 or above
           (if SUNs exhibit the same defect then it may be resolvable as a
            no fix)
         - No system crashes (panics) in the last 5 working days
         - Has passed all available NFS functional tests
         - All final NFS commands (from ISO/SSO) in place
         - 75% of SUN NFS performance demonstratable (330-330)


   Level 1 System Stress  - characterized by being able to execute:
         - 5 concurrent file copies thru NFS
         - 2 concurrent NFS functional tests 
         - 3 concurrent Quick Regression tests

   Level 2 System Stress  - characterized by being able to execute: 
         - 10 concurrent file copies thru NFS
         - 3 concurrent NFS functional tests 
         - 1 NFS functional test with 50% CPU loading
         - 3 Node testing with slow (310 and 320) servers 

   Level 3 System Stress  - characterized by being able to execute: 
         - 10 concurrent file copies thru NFS
         - 5 concurrent NFS functional tests 
         - 2 NFS functional test with 80% CPU loading
         - 4 Node testing with slow (310 and 320) servers 
         - 3 Node testing with all nodes both as NFS requesters and servers
         - Mounts of at least 4 remote file system simultaneously

Project Checkpoint						  Goal

48 HOUR RELIABILITY                                           	 4/30/87

    Status Summary:

	The NFS/300 testing team accomplished all of its primary objectives
	for the 48-hour reliability checkpoint.  During this phase of the 
	project, the team remained on schedule despite a reduction in 
	staffing (by 1 MTS) and an increase in testing responsibility; the 
	YP test suites.

	Most of the deliverables arrived ahead of schedule.  Deliverables 
	which were not met were delayed due to lack of testing equipment.


   Deliverables:						Completed:
        1) 48 Hour system reliability at Level 2 stress		 4/18/87
        2) 95% of NFS functional test progs complete (97.8%)	 4/29/87
        3) Security test suites complete			 4/27/87
        4) System recovery test suites complete			 3/18/87
        5) Un*x/Un*x connectivity test suites complete		 4/16/87
        6) SUN gateway testing complete				 -------
        7) Series 300 gateway testing complete 			 -------


    Dependencies:			On whom:	By:	Completed:
	1) NFS Corner Case Test Suites   Nerfs        3/25/87    -------
	2) YP Functional Test Suites	 Nerfs        3/25/87    see note
	3) Sun Gateway Configuration	 Lab Equip    4/1/87     -------

	5) Stable Level B system         Nerfs/Peking 4/8/87	 4/14/87
 

    Deviations:
	1) YP Functional Test Suites
	   Responsibility for the YP functional test suite was taken 
	   over by the Transformer project.  This additional respon-
	   sibility cost approximately 8 engineer days, but was handled
	   without causing any slip in the original schedule.

	   Cost:  Engineer days 8;  Calendar days 0;

        2) Gateway Testing
	   S300 gateway testing was rescheduled due to the lack of s300
	   system resources.  The existing s300 resources were dedicated
	   to functional, reliability and stress testing in an attempt to 
	   stabilize the early systems.  Although s300 gateway testing was 
	   not completed, the system did have exposure to s300 gateways and 
	   operated without problems.  Sun gateway testing was rescheduled 
	   due to the Sun2/160 being unavailable in the desired timeframe.  
	   These tasks have been rescheduled for mid-May.

	   Cost:  Engineer days 0;  Calendar days 0;
	   
	3) NFS Corner Case Test Suites
	   As of 4/30, the NFS corner case test suite has not been completed 
	   by the NERFS project team.

	   Cost:  Engineer days --;  Calendar days --;

	4) Equipment
	   Availability of s300 test equipment continues to affect the 
	   project team.  The team has been extremely flexible in sharing
	   and obtaining test systems; the K-cats, which are on loan from
	   TWO, have been a critical element in maintaining enough viable 
	   test systems.

	   Cost:  Engineer days 7;  Calendar days 0;
