The NFS development and testing effort is being done 
by a joint project team consisting of two project groups 
from CND and one project group from ISO.
This document addresses only the project-specific requirements 
for these groups. 
.sp 1
Traditionally, all product and project requirements
were addressed in a single document.  Due to the inter-divisional nature
of this project, the product and project requirements are addressed
in separate documents.  For information regarding the requirements 
of the NFS product, refer to the NFS Product Requirements document.
.sp 1 
Unless otherwise stated, all requirements and comments herein refer 
to both the series 300 and the series 800.

.H 2 "R&D Partners"
.sp 1
.ad
In addition to the project groups directly involved in the NFS
product, a number of
other R&D project groups are responsible for various levels of 
support.  Each group and their relationship to 
the NFS project groups is described below.
.na
.sp 1
.nf
	CND - 	PEKING Convergence Group: provide a converged 
		s300/s800 network architecture.
		Project Manager: Dean Thompson
.sp 1
	CND - 	S300/S800 Services Group: provide cross-testing
		for ARPA/Berkeley, NS, and NFS services.
		Project Manager: Chris Fuggit
.sp 1
    	IND - 	Transports/LLA Group: s800 network transport support
		Project Manager: Gregg Levin

.H 2 "Support from Partners"
.sp 1
The Nerfs' project requires the following functionality be provided by
the appropriate partner(s).
.sp 2
.nf
.cu 1
Symbolic links
.sp 1
Symbolic links are considered necessary for a fully usable
NFS product.  All major NFS implementations support symbolic 
	links.
.sp 1
Symbolic links will be provided by SSO and ISO for the s300
and s800 respectively.
.sp 1
.cu 1
Converged network architecture
.sp 1
The s300 will require  HP-UX 6.0 with the IND 4.2-based  network
architecture.  Convergence from the s300 Leaf Node  architecture
to IND's  4.2-based  network  architecture  is being done by the
PEKING  project  
.sp 1
.cu 1
HP-UX commands and libraries
.sp 1
A number of HP-UX commands and libraries are affected by the 
existence of NFS.  These commands and libraries will need
to be modified in order to operate in an NFS environment.
.sp 1
The SSO - HPUX commands group and the ISO HPUX commands
group will be responsible for making the necessary 
modifications.
.sp 1
.H 2 "Man-Month Resources"

.H 2 "Equipment Requirements"
.sp 1
.ad
This equipment plan addresses the needs of the NFS development group
and the NFS testing group (i.e., Jeff's and Bill's groups).

.H 2 "Key Assumptions"
.ad
.sp 1
The s300 network architecture convergence will be successful
and will be delivered in a timely manner.
.sp 1
The s300 vnode layer support will be provided by SSO.
.sp 1
The s800 vnode layer support will be provided by ISO.
.sp 1
The HP-UX commands groups (ISO/SSO) will provide technical
support for changes necessary for NFS compatibility.
.sp 1
The HP Internet will be used for exchanging shared source
code and project information.
.sp 1
In the event of semantic differences between NFS commands and
HP-UX commands, the NFS commands will be modified to avoid 
conflicting with HP-UX semantics.  User-visible differences
in the HP-NFS product (i.e., HP vs Sun) will be minimized.
.sp 1
.na
.H 2 "Potential Problems / Contingencies
.ad 
.sp 1
If the s300 network architecture convergence effort is not 
successful, the NerFS project will port NFS onto the s300
leafnode architecture.  This could significantly change the
project's effort estimates and scheduling would need to be
revised.
.sp 1
If the s300 vnode layer is not provided by SSO, CND will 
provide the necessary resources to provide such support.
The project schedule will be impacted accordingly.
.sp 1
If the s800 vnode layer is not provided by ISO, CND will 
provide the necessary resources to provide such support.
The project schedule will be impacted accordingly.
.sp 1
If SSO and/or ISO do not provide the necessary resources 
to modify the HP-UX commands affected by NFS,  CND will
provide the resources.  The project schedule will be 
impacted accordingly.
.sp 1
If the HP Internet proves to be unreliable, ISO and CND
will revert back to using magnetic cartridge tapes to
exchange intermediate releases and project information.
.sp 1
.H 2 "Tactics"
.sp 1
.H 2 "Project Objectives"
.sp 1
These objectives should be strictly related to project-process goals.
