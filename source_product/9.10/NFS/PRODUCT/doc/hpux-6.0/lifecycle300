This paper started as the project lifecycle
for the PROJECT NERFS.  It then expanded to 
include the efforts by ISO and IND on the Series 800
in addition to the work done by CND on the Series 300.
This program is involved with
putting SUN's Network File System product on the
Series 300 and Series 800.
Now the paper is being split into a part for the 300 and a
part for the 800.  
It will list what needs to
be done and what will be the deliverables from each
functional group at each phase of the program.
In order to have a handle to apply to this program,
the name NERFS will continue to be used.  It will refer to the
NFS program as spanning across multiple divisions.
The NERFS lifecycle will not follow the normal CND lifecycle
as NERFS will be porting existing code from SUN.

In addition to this lifecycle, there are more detailed
lifecycles for the various areas such as technical 
support.
