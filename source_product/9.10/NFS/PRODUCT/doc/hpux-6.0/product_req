The s300/s800 NFS project is responsible for providing Sun's Network File
System  (NFS) on the HP 9000  Series  300/800  HP-UX  systems.  NFS
provides a means of transparently sharing  files among heterogeneous
systems on a common network.  Remote  file  access remains invisible
to users.
.sp 1
The NFS  code  will be  ported  from  source  code  provided  by Sun
Microsystems,   Inc.  in  accordance   with  Sun's  NFS   technology
licensing  agreement.  To insure compatibility and connectivity in a
multi-vendor network environment, the HP NFS product will conform to
the  multi-vendor  industry standards   implemented  by  Sun.  These
standards are defined by the NFS protocol specifications.
.sp 1
Unless otherwise stated, all objectives and comments herein refer
to both the series 300 and the series 800.
.na
.H 1 "PRODUCT OBJECTIVES"
.H 2 "Key Product Features"
.ad
The objective of the NFS project is to provide an industry 
standard remote file access capability across heterogeneous 
operating systems for the HP 9000 s300/s800.  The NFS Services/300 
and NFS Services/800 products will be based on Sun's 3.0 release 
of NFS.  The primary features of these products include:
.na
.nf

	o The industry standard Network File System (NFS).
	  Capabilities include mounting of remote file systems
	  and accessing remote files across a local area network.

	o The Yellow Pages services (YP).
	  A service, independent from NFS, that provides a
	  centrally administered, distributed data lookup service.

	o Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and 
	  External Data Representation (XDR).
	  A programmatic interface for inter-process communication,
	  including machine independent data formats.

	o The PC-NFS daemon, pcnfsd(1m).

	o Associated NFS/RPC User Commands.
.fi
.bp
.H 2 "Quality Objectives"
.ad
The overall goal is to have a product of quality equal to or better
than Sun's NFS product.
The quality objectives are based
on the FURPS model.
.na
.sp 2
.H 3 "Functionality Objectives"
.sp 1
.nf
	MUST	- Provide 100 percent of Sun's NFS (rel 3.0)
		  functionality The exact feature set is defined 
		  by the MUST level objectives in the Detailed 
		  Functionality section.

.fi
.sp 2
.H 3 "Usability Objectives"
.sp 1
.nf
	MUST 	- Provide natural language support (NLS), otherwise
		  known as "localizibility".  Localizibility includes
		    o support of 7, 8, and 16 bit characters,
		    o conformance with the HP-15 standard (see notice),
		    o support for local customs (e.g., date formats),
		    o support for message catalogues.


	================================================================
				IMPORTANT NOTICE

	A  design  flaw  exists  in  the  current  HP-15  Standard.  The
	Standard  restricts  computer  systems  on the same  network  to
	support the same 16-bit  character  set.  The existing  uucp and
	LAN products are in violation of this restriction.

	THERE WILL BE NO ATTEMPT IN THIS PROJECT TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM.
	================================================================


	MUST	- The user must be able to optionally configure
		  the NFS product into the HP-UX kernel.

	MUST 	- Usability greater than or equal to Sun, as
		  measured by feedback from Beta sites.

	MUST 	- Provide HP-quality documentation.

	HW	- Provide a common user interface for the s300
		  and s800.

	W 	- Improve diagnostic and error messages
		  (i.e., readability and correctness).

	W	- Provide system configuration tools.

s300 Reliability Objectives
.sp 1
The reliability objectives for the NFS Services/300 product 
address user-space code and kernel code separately.  
Essentially, the objectives for the NFS Services/300 product are to 
1) attain HP quality for all NFS kernel code and 
2) to attain quality equal to or better than Sun's 
NFS product for all NFS user-space code.
.sp 1
The reliability objectives for the NFS Services/300 product 
are significantly less stringent than those for the s800 product.  
.sp 1
.nf
	MUST	- Fix all known defects with DTS weights greater than
		  or equal to six.

	MUST 	- Obtain 70 percent code depth coverage for kernel code.

	MUST	- Demonstrate overall system reliability by successfully
		  completing 24, 48 and 120 hour reliability tests.

	MUST	- Have no system crashes caused by unknown NFS
		  defects during the last 20 calendar days before
		  release to manufacturing.

	MUST 	- Show that the number of outstanding medium, serious and 
		  critical defects known at release to manufacturing is 
		  less than or equal to the number of medium, serious and 
		  critical defects known to exist in Sun's NFS product.

	MUST	- Pass all tests in the functional test suite as
		  a final bits test.  For the s300 product, this test
		  must be run before releasing the bits to SSIT
		  and also after SSIT has returned the final bits.

	MUST	- Pass the Sun-supplied NFS tests.

	HW	- Kernel code depth coverage will be equal to or
		  greater than 85 percent (ING goal).

	HW 	- Obtain 70 percent code depth coverage for user code.

	HW	- Attain a SRs/KNCSS less than or equal to 0.1212 
		  SD/KNCSS, assuming 12/87 shipments.



s800 Reliability Objectives
.sp 1
.fi
.ad b
See the NFS/800 Project Plan and Life Cycle for definition of the
quality certification criteria that will be met at various
milestones for the NFS/800 project.  
These criteria 
are derived from the
Spectrum HP-UX Certification Acceptance Criteria and are
consistent with the HP-PA release 2.0 program objectives.  
They include defect density, code coverage (both depth and
breadth coverage), and number of hours of reliability.
.sp 1
Other quality objectives for NFS/800 are listed below.
.sp 1
.nf
	MUST	- Demonstrate code stability by showing that the
		  following measures have a consistent downward trend.
		  The two code stability measures are 1) module change
		  rate, and 2) rate of defect detection.  Any indication
		  of increasing rates or rates which have peaked and
		  flattened out will result in non-acceptance of the
		  software.

	MUST	- Have no system crashes caused by unknown NFS
		  defects during the last 20 calendar days before
		  release to manufacturing.

	MUST 	- Show that the number of outstanding medium, serious 
		  and critical defects known at release to manufacturing 
		  is less than or equal to the number of medium, serious 
		  and critical defects known to exist in Sun's NFS product.

	MUST	- Pass all tests in the functional test suite as
		  a final bits test.  

	MUST	- Pass the Sun-supplied NFS tests.

	HW	- Code depth coverage will be equal to or
		  greater than 85 percent (ING goal).

	HW	- Attain a SRs/KNCSS less than or equal to 0.1080
		  SD/KNCSS, assuming 3/88 shipments.

.fi
.sp 2
.H 3 "Performance Objectives"
.sp 1
.ad
Performance comparisons will be made
between two HP systems and two Sun systems.  The
comparisons will involve equivalent hardware systems.
For testing purposes, the performance of equivalent
systems should be evaluated under similar loads
and conditions.
.sp 1
.nf
	MUST	- Attain performance competitive with Sun's NFS 
		  performance as measured by a NFS specific benchmark. 
		  These comparison will be performed on systems 
		  configured with equivalent hardware.  The actual 
		  benchmark has not been determined.  Specifically,
		  attain the following level of performance:

		  Model 330:  75% of Sun 3/160
		  Model 350:  75% of Sun 3/260
		  Model 825:  55% of Sun 3/260

		  The HP systems listed above are in the same general
		  price range as the corresponding Sun systems.

	MUST	- Attain YP performance equal to Sun's, as measured
		  by the average elapsed time for a user to log into
		  a system.

	HW	- Attain performance equal to or better than Sun's
		  NFS performance.  Specifically:

		  Model 330:  at least equal to Sun 3/160
		  Model 350:  at least equal to Sun 3/260
		  Model 825:  at least 85% Sun 3/260

	HW	- Attain Yellow Pages performance better than Sun's
		  as measured by the average elapsed time for a user
		  to log in.
.fi
.sp 2
.H 3 "Supportability Objectives"
.sp 1
.nf
	MUST	- Provide NFS-specific diagnostic capabilities which
		  are functionally equivalent to those provided by
		  Sun.

	MUST 	- Attain a level of supportability better than or
		  equal to Sun, as evaluated by Beta sites.

	HW	- Provide better diagnostic capabilities than Sun's.
.fi
.bp
.H 2 "Detailed Functional Objectives"
.nf
	MUST 	- Provide NFS capabilities for the s300/800 HP-UX
		  systems.  NFS provides transparent access to
		  files in a heterogeneous environment. Specific
		  capabilities include mounting remote file systems
		  and transparently accessing remote files.

	MUST    - Support the programmatic interfaces to the
		  YP or RPC/XDR libraries.  

	MUST	- Provide the Yellow Pages (YP) services.
		  Specifically, provide the user level commands
		  needed for global system administration of 
		  certain "key" name files (e.g.,  /etc/passwd and
		  /etc/hosts). See Appendix 1 for a list of commands.

	MUST	- Provide associated NFS/RPC user level commands.

	MUST	- Provide the pcnfsd(1m) daemon. The pcnfsd(1m) daemon
		  provides MS-DOS clients running Sun's PC-NFS
		  with remote file access, user authentication and
		  remote printing capabilities on HP-UX systems.

	MUST 	- Modify selected HP-UX commands affected by NFS so that
		  they correctly function in a networked file system.
		  See Appendix 5 for the list of commands that will
		  require modification.

	HW	- Modify all HP-UX commands affected by NFS so that
		  they correctly function in a networking file system.
.fi
.bp
.H 2 "System Attributes"
.ad
In  addition  to the formal  quality  objectives,  other
objectives  related  to  system  attributes  are  considered  vital.
Meeting  these  objectives  will  result in a product  that  will be
perceived as being highly usable in a  multi-vendor
environment and as exhibiting "HP added value."

.sp 2
.H 3 "Compatibility Objectives"
.sp 1
.nf
	MUST	- NFS must be object code compatible with
		  previous HP-UX releases.  Customers should
		  not have to re-compile programs that perform
		  local file system operations.

	MUST	- NFS, RPC and XDR protocols must be compatible
		  with Sun's implementation.

	MUST 	- NFS must coexist with current HP networking
		  products: specifically the NS and the ARPA/
		  Berkeley services.  Co-existence is defined as
		  the ability to
		      o be co-operable,
		      o share the same hardware,
		      o share the same network drivers, and
		      o use the same network.

	MUST	- NFS must coexist with HP-UX/discless/300 nodes.

	MUST	- NFS must be integrated with HP-UX in such
		  a way that it does not conflict with the HP-UX
		  standard.

	HW	- Provide a user interface that is identical
		  to Sun's.  Obvious exceptions to this would
		  be improved error messages and commands that
		  must be modified to avoid conflicts with the
		  HP-UX standard.

	HW	- Provide a programmatic interface that is
		  identical to Sun's.  Note that this programmatic 
		  interface is provided, but not fully supported.

The following objectives deal with timeliness to market. Although
they do not relate to traditional quality metrics, they do have a
significant impact on how successful the NFS product will be.
.na
.sp 2
.nf
	MUST	- Ship the s300 NFS products by December '87.

	MUST	- Release the series 300 NFS concurrent with
		  or before the 6.0 HP-UX release.

		  or before the 2.0 HP-UX release.
.fi
.bp
.H 2 "User Definition"
.nf
	General Customers
	  - individuals that already have NFS running on other systems.
	  - companies that want remote file access between computers with
	    heterogeneous operating systems.

	Initial Customers
	  - users familiar with NFS.
	  - engineers using CAE, CAD, CAM and CASE applications.
	  - government-driven, defense industrial complexes.
	  - university research environments.

	Future Customers
	  - volume end users who need to access files across systems
	    with heterogeneous operating systems (e.g., Fortune 500
	    corporations doing CAD, CAD, CAM and CASE tasks).
	  - end users who need to connect MS-DOS based PCs and PC
	    networks with systems operating in a technical computing
	    environment.

.fi
.bp
.H 2 "Product Environment"
.H 3 "Hardware Environment"
.sp 1
.ad
The target hardware is an HP 9000 s300 or s800 HP-UX computer system.
.sp 1
The S300 host computer must be equipped with a
98643A DIO-LAN or an equivalent built-in LAN interface for the
Model 330 and 350.  The S800 host computer must be equipped with a
27125A/B CIO-LAN interface card.
.sp 1
The minimal useful configuration is one HP 9000 s300 or s800
and one other node. Both must support NFS, connect to the
same LAN cable, and use the same physical-level protocol
(ETHERNET or IEEE 802.3).
.na
.sp 2
.H 3 "Software Environment"
.sp 1
.ad
The target software environment for the NFS product is the
HP-UX operating system with TCP/IP support, including the
inetd daemon and sockets.  
.sp 1
On the Series 300, NFS depends on the HP-UX AXE product,
and the NS-ARPA Services/300 product.  On the Series 800,
NFS depends on the HP-UX product and the LAN/800 product
(previously called LINK/800).
.sp2
.bp
.H 2 "Non-Objectives"
.nf
	The following items are specific NON objectives for
	this project:

	  WILL NOT - Provide Sun 3.2 NFS features.

	  WILL NOT - Support 4.2 or 4.3 BSD features unless they
		     are specific to NFS or currently exist in HP-UX.

	  WILL NOT - Provide 4.3 BSD quota functionality.
		     Quota functionality provides a way of
		     limiting the amount of file system space
		     that any single user can consume.

	  WILL NOT - Provide "discless" workstation capabilities.
		     NOTE: HP-UX/Discless/300 is providing discless 
		     workstation capabilities for the Series 300.

	  WILL NOT - Provide access to remote device files.

	  WILL NOT - Provide the rarpd daemon or arp command.
		     No NFS-specific functionality is provided by
		     rarpd or arp.
