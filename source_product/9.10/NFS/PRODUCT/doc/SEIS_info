  SEIS is a system that collects project metrics for the NFS project.
  It looks at the DTS database to get data.  It can be used to produce
  graphs on defects.

  There are three machines involved with the information needed by SEIS:

     hpcndm - Contains the DTS databases in /usr/DTS/defectdb/nfscmds and
	      /usr/DTS/defectdb/nfs300.
	      Contains the two files that hold the mapping between
	      the module names that SEIS knows about and the module names
	      that can be found in the old nfs DTS reports.
	      Since SEIS can only use a small number of modules, we
	      decided to fold the large number of specific module
	      names into several high level module names.
	      These files are /usr/DTS/SEIS/nfscmds and /usr/DTS/SEIS/nfs300.

     hpcndaw - This is where the SEIS user interface program exists.  It
	       is executed as /users/seis/seis.  This is how one gets
	       graphs created.  It is also where one sets up the module
	       name and location of the code configuration files.
	       Please see the SEIS user manual for more details.

     hpcndk  - The files that decribe the mapping of SEIS module names 
	       to code files can be found here.  The file names are
	       /users/nerfs/mikey/SEIS/cmds/SEIS_Code_Conf and
	       /source/nerfs/mikey/SEIS/kernel/SEIS_Code_Conf.
