 DESCRIPTION

 Provide increased performance, increased functionality and defect
 fixes for the Network File System (NFS) on the HP9000 Series 300/800
 HP-UX operating system. The NFS product was ported from Sun Microsystems' 
 Network File System (NFS) version 3.0, in accordance with Sun's NFS 
 licensing agreement. The NFS product was first released on the series
 300 with version 6.0 of the HP-UX operating system and on the series 800
 with version 2.0 of HP-UX.
 
 Dave Matthews' NFS development group will have primary responsibility for
 the enhancements to NFS. This will include test plans and test development
 for any new functionality added to the product. Dan Simula's project team
 will be responsible for incorporating new tests into the scaffold and running
 regression and reliability tests. Other groups in IND, UKL and UDL are 
 providing key support for NFS performance and functionality enhancements.

 MARKET CONTRIBUTION
 
 An increase in performance over the version of NFS released with the HP-UX
 6.0 product is required to remain competitive. Addition of the Virtual Home 
 Environment (VHE) functionality will provide a user with the same view 
 of his computing environment from any workstation in a specified group
 of workstations.

 KEY PROJECT "MUST" OBJECTIVES
 
 On the s300 attain performance equal to or better than 75 percent of Sun's 
 NFS performance for equivalent hardware systems. A high want is to meet 
 or exceed SUN's NFS performance.

 Add Virtual Home Environment (VHE) functionality to the NFS product.

 Provide support for long filenames with NFS on the series 300.

 Provide other minor functionality enhancements.

 Incorporate on the s300 HP-UX 6.2 release defect fixes that were shipped 
 with the s800 HP-UX 2.0 release.

 Incorporate on the s800 HP-UX 3.0 release defect fixes that were shipped
 with the s300 HP-UX 6.2 release.

 Release the enhanced series 300 HP-NFS concurrent with the HP-UX 6.2
 release and the enhanced series 800 HP-NFS concurrent with the HP-UX
 3.0 release.
