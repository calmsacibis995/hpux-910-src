This document contains the CND s800 release 3.0 program milestones and the
corresponding deliverables and dependencies.  
The target dates for the milestones are based on the HP-UX program 
3.0 release integration cycles. 
.sp
The two major objectives of this document are to provide logical 
checkpoints based on the individual CND project team schedules
and to centralize a list of major dependencies which the involved project
teams have on each other or on external entities.  
.sp
This document is a working document used by the CND groups involved on
the s800 3.0 release.  The deliverables listed for each checkpoint are 
specified for these groups, with other external projects covered under 
dependencies.
.sp
ASSUMPTIONS:  The NS, ARPA and NFS products for the s300 release 6.2 and 
the NS, ARPA and NFS 800 products for the s800 3.0 release will be nearly 
identical.

.H 1 "GENERAL DEPENDENCIES"
.ad
.sp
This section lists general dependencies the CND groups have on
different partners.   Listed below are the dependencies, which
groups have to meet those dependencies and a brief explanation of 
what they consist of:
.sp
Lab Dependencies:
.sp
.AL
.LI
Participation on the SWAT team. 
A member each of the HP-UX (UKL), SAPPHIRE (UKL), RPC (IND) and TRANSPORT (IND)
groups should be part of the SWAT team.  The SWAT representative can be either 
always the same person or different people on a rotational schedule.
The SWAT team is called when there is a major defect that is stopping any
further testing by the arsenal group.  The resolution of the defect that 
caused the SWAT team to be called becomes the main task of all members of the 
team until that defect is characterized and fixed.
.LI
Internet available when needed.
Most of the processes implemented between CND and UKL/IND rely heavily on the 
Internet.
If the Internet is not up the turn-around for some of our deliverables will
jump from an hour or two to a day or more.  This will become specially
critical when the integration cycles begin.
