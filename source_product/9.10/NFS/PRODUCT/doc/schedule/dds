# Under overhead (which does not need to be tracked) are listed:
# 	. technical consulting for Tech. support and Marketing
#	. TWG involvement based on reading notes, posting replies and 
#	  keeping track of proposals that affect us
#	. project documents maintenance
#	. building nightly/weekly development systems for group distributions
#	. group and program team meetings
#	. monthly project and objectives, weekly objectives
#	. coordinate with partners since it is mainly based on interrupts
#	. time spent doing schedule estimates

# NOTE: Tasks completed since the last update have been listed first.  Next
# revision they will be moved to the bottom.  The task left are listed in

# NOTE: Overhead tasks worked on in this time frame include looking at commands
# that are not working with ISO and that are needed by Transformers (includes
# getting find and tar working so that we can mount the scaffold remotely.) Also
# created a script that tells up what has changed between one version of the
# kernel and the next (requested by Jim Hunter).  I have also been helping
# SSO some when they have had problems with connectivity. Finally, I have been
# working with Mikey and George on various kernel problems.

# NOTE: Overhead since last update includes 1) Proving security hole
# exists that allows a normal user on one system using only the socket
# interface to access files via NFS that do not belong to him, 2) Helping
# John and Marie figure out a problem with NFS/RPC that turns out to be yet
# another version of the "no transaction ID for non-idempotent requests" bug,
# and 3) normal other misc. overhead, like handling the hardware crash of DU.,
# tracking down the latest version of the ".." problem, etc.

# Overhead during last period includes trouble shooting various problems
# with EB1 and the LAB meetings, etc. that we had.
# Also spent time helping the Transformers with various problems, only
