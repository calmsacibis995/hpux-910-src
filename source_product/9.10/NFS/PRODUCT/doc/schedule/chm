# Under overhead (which does not need to be tracked) are listed:
# 	. technical consulting for Tech. support and Marketing
#	. TWG involvement based on reading notes, posting replies and 
#	  keeping track of proposals that affect us
#	. project documents maintenance
#	  	. concerns lists, agendas
#	. group and program team meetings
#	. monthly project and objectives, weekly objectives
#	. Coordinate with partners since it is mainly based on interrupts
