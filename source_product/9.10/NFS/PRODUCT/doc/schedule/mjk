# This is my schedule for the work on NFS on the s800.
# Under overhead (which does not need to be tracked) are listed:
# 	. technical consulting for Tech. support and Marketing
#	. TWG involvement based on reading notes, posting replies and 
#	  keeping track of proposals that affect us
#	. project documents maintenance
#	. building nightly/weekly development systems for group distributions
#	. group and program team meetings
#	. monthly project and objectives, weekly objectives
#	. Coordinate with partners since it is mainly based on interrupts
#
# 0.1 = 48 min
# 0.2 = 1h 36 min
# 0.3 = 2h 24 min
# 0.4 = 3h 12 min
# 0.5 = 4h
# 0.6 = 4h 48 min
# 0.7 = 5h 36 min
