.H 1 "Alpha/Beta-Site Pretesting (Steve Booth)

RESPONSIBLE ENGINEER: Steve Booth

The state of the NFS code must be well-known for each of three planned
pre-releases, one in late March or early April, a second in late May or
early June, and a possible third pre-release in July.
This chapter outlines the steps that will be taken to determine
the state of the code for each pre-release.

Should the testing determine that the code is not ready for release,
a short summary document will be written explaining what needs to be
done to make the code ready for release.  Each beta site will receive
a summary document listing known deficiencies in the beta code.

This chapter will not define additional tests for the scaffold; it
will use those NFS scaffold tests which exist when beta-site testing
commences.

The summary document (above) will indicate whether the
number and content of tests was sufficient to determine
the readiness of the code.

Defect weighting is as defined by the Defect Tracking System
(DTS) program in common use by HP-UX testers.

.H 2 "NFS/300 Pre-release Strategy"

What follows is the current plan for early release of the code
for beta sites and Business Opportunities (B.O.'s):

Key people in this area are Carole Crall (CND Tech Support),
Andy Drol (CND Marketing), and Jeff Lindberg (NerFS project
manager).

CND R&D and  Marketing  have  agreed to support  three (3) customers
receiving  pre-releases  of the NFS/300 product.  This is the combined total
of beta sites and  B.O.'s.  It is uncertain whether there will be
1 or 2 beta  sites.  Alpha  sites  (internal  HP users  not
directly   involved  in  the  NFS  project)  are  being  handled
separately, and are not included in this number.

Some of the  accounts  identified  by Les  Walker's  team in FSD
marketing as potential  NFS early  release  sites may qualify as
full  fledged  beta  sites.  The  level of  commitment  from the
field,  multi-vendor  configurations,  and expected usage of NFS
are the key criteria used to select beta sites.  Other  accounts
may fall into the  category of B.O.'s,  which are general  early
releases given to customers for HP business  reasons,  without a
formal beta site  agreement.  The time-line for selecting  these
sites and for early shipments is listed later.

For beta sites, the account SE will be the first line of support
for  responding to problems and  questions.  The SE will rely on
CND  Tech  Support  (Carole)  for the  next  level  of  support,
followed by the NerFS R&D project  group. 
The support  mechanism  for B.O.'s has not been resolved,
but should follow the same strategy as the beta sites
as much as possible.

The  first  beta/B.O.  release  will
piggyback on the system built in the second  300/6.0 SSIT cycle.
Second draft manuals will be included with this release.

.H 3 "Alpha Sites"

Early  releases will be provided to three HP internal
alpha sites:  HP Labs at Palo Alto, HP Labs at Bristol, and Salt
Lake  Operation.  These alpha sites will be supported through
the NerFS R&D project group.  The system built in
the first 300/6.0 SSIT cycle will be the first alpha release.

.H 3 "Other Pre-Releases"

It may be necessary to provide additional early releases, near the end of
the project, to high priority  customers.  The output of later SSIT cycles
and the latest draft of the manuals will be used for  these  shipments.

There is no time budgeted for supporting these early releases before the
final release to SSIT.
