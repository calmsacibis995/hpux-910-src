.H 2 "rusers Test Plan"

This chapter covers the
.B rusers
command.  The main use of this command is to list information about
what users are on each of the
hosts on the network, and how long they have been idle.
It provides much the same functionality as the Berkeley
.B rwho
command.  The main distinction is that Berkeley
.B rwho
uses a database of values collected from hosts sending broadcast
packets, one a minute (or so), and therefore the database may be
out of date.  The
.B rusers
command, on the other hand, polls all the hosts on the network each time
it is run, so the values should be more accurate.

.sp 1
Test
.B rusers
with no options.
It should print information about the hosts on the network.
Look for the local host; if it's present the test passes.

.H 4 "bad option"

PERFORM TIME:    1.0 md
TYPE OF TEST:    functional
EXPECTED OUTPUT: no output if the test passes
.fi
.sp 1
Test
.B rusers
with any option besides "-l", "-h", "a", "-i", or "-u".
It should print the usage error message on stderr
and exit with a non-zero status.
Use the "-d" option with no parameters.  Also, run 
.B rusers 
with all the following options together:
"-i", "-u", "-h" and a hostname.

.H 4 "good options"
.sp 1

IMPLEMENT TIME:  1.25 md
PERFORM TIME:    1.25 md
TYPE OF TEST:    functional
EXPECTED OUTPUT: no output if the test passes
.fi
.sp 1
Test
.B rusers
with all combinations of the valid options listed above.
Run 
.B rusers 
with the "-d" option and a hostname.
Test with zero hosts, the local host, and then the local host and a
remote host.  In all cases, information about the local host should be
present in the output.  It should be sufficient to merely check for the
presence of the local host and current user name;
the options control the format or order of
the output.  It might be worthwhile to see if they fit the desired
pattern, but checking the order or values in the output is unnecessary.

The functionality of the rusers daemon is covered by the rusers tests.
The following tests were added to increase the BFA coverage for the
rusers daemon:
.sp
.AL
.LI
Use pmap_conf with the "-p" option to call rpc.rusersd, program 100002,
versions 1 and 2 with procedure 4 (not defined, it will execute the default 
case on the case statement).
