.H 2  "Fsirand (Cristina Mahon)"

.ad
.PP
Fsirand installs random inode generation numbers on all the
inodes on the specified device and also installs a filesystem
ID in the superblock.
.PP
The command line for fsirand is:
.sp
           fsirand [ -p ] device_name
.sp 
WARNING: Fsirand must be used only on an unmounted filesystem
that has been checked with fsck.  The only exception is that it
can be used on the root filesystem in single-user mode, if the
system is immediately re-booted afterwards.
.sp
Due to the high risk involved in using this command, these tests
should probably be interactive tests.

.sp 1
.PP
.ad
First run fsirand -p on that device and save the information.
Then run fsirand on that device and verify, through another fsirand -p,
that the inode, generation pairs have changed.  
Make sure the disk is unmounted!
.sp
.nf
TYPE OF TEST: 
       functional
EXPECTED OUTPUT: 
.ad
       The output of the second fsirand -p should be different from 
the first and the disk should be correct (an fsck should not detect
any errors).
