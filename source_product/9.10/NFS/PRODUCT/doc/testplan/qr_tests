.H 2 "Development Strategy"
.nf

a) Will start by porting rfa test suite. 20md
b) Modify tests for differing file system functionality.  (e.g.
   cd does not behave the same with NFS) 2md
c) Add tests for NFS specific functionality.  (mount, umount) 3md
d) Add appropriate tests from the NerFS functional tests. 2md

Most of the tests chosen for the Quick Regression Test Suite will
be from section 2 of the brick pages.  Since the commands in section
1 and section 3 rely on the commands in section 2, this will be the
more efficient set of tests for exercising the system.
