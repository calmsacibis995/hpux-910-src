.H 2 "rwall Test Plan"

This chapter covers the
.B rwall
command.  The main use of this command is to broadcast a message to all
users on all the hosts on the network.
It provides much the same functionality as the Berkeley
.B wall
command.  The main distinction is that Berkeley
.B wall
only broadcasts messages to users on the local host.

PERFORM TIME:    1.0 md
TYPE OF TEST:    functional
EXPECTED OUTPUT:  no output if the test passes
.fi
.sp 1
Test
.B rwall
with no options.
It should print the usage error message on stderr
and exit with a non-zero status.

.H 4 "bad option"

IMPLEMENT TIME:  0.25 md
PERFORM TIME:    1.0 md
TYPE OF TEST:    functional
EXPECTED OUTPUT: no output if the test passes
.fi
.sp 1
Test
.B rwall
with any option besides "-h" or "-n".
It should print the usage error message on stderr
and exit with a non-zero status.
Note: this test should not attempt to use the "-d" option, since this is
often used as an undocumented "debug" option.
Call 
.B rwall 
with a bogus host name.
Call
.B rwall
with a message that is longer than 1024 characters.
.sp 2
.H 4 "good options"
.sp 1
.nf
IMPLEMENT TIME:  0.5 md
PERFORM TIME:    1.0 md
TYPE OF TEST:    functional
EXPECTED OUTPUT: no output if the test passes
.fi
.sp 1
Test
.B rwall
with all combinations of the valid options listed above.
Test with the local host, and then the local host and a remote host.
Test with one or more network groups containing the local host.
In all cases, a message should be written to all terminals on the local
host.  This test should probably be done manually.
Caution: this test could mess up
tests running on other hosts using rlogin or telnet, since they will not
be expecting broadcast messages to appear in their output!

.H 2 "Rwalld test plan"
.sp
The functionality of the rwall daemon is covered by the rwall tests.
The following tests were added to increase the BFA coverage for the
rwall daemon:
.sp
.AL
.LI
Use pmap_conf with the "-p" option to call rpc.rwalld, program 100008,
version 1 procedure 4 (not defined, it will execute the default case on 
the case statement).
