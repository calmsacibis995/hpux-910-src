Funtional testing
-----------------
 - Basic tests
   - Loop back NFS automounts
     - direct maps
     - indirect maps
   - Remote NFS automounts
     - direct maps
     - indirect maps
 - Automount Options and command line
   -m  Suppress initialization of directory-map pairs listed in the auto.master
       NIS database.
   -n  Disable dynamic mounts.
   -T  Tracing.  Expand each NFS call and display it on the standard output.
   -v  Verbose.  Log status messages to the console.
   -D  Set environment variable with the -D option.  Also make sure automount
       inherits other environment variables.  Make sure environment variables
       are processed correctly in maps with and without braces.
   -f  Read a local file for initialization, ahead of the auto.master NIS map.
   -M  Where to mount temporary file systems.
   -tl Time to leave file sytems mounted.
   -tm Time between attempts to mount a filesystem.
   -tw Time between attempts to unmount a filesystem.
 - Automount Maps
   - Map types
     - NIS
       - auto.master and NIS map file and inluding from NIS map file
     - Included Maps
       - local map file includes local map file NIS and map file
     - Special Maps
       - -hosts
       - -passwd / auto.home ; ~ tilde character
       - -null
   - substitutions
   - subdirectories
   - syntax - \; "the directory" etc.
   - hierarchical mappings and mount points
   - multiple server locations
 - errors, failures

System testing
--------------
 - run the filesystem tests over automounted filesystems
 - bdf
 - mount
 - umount
 - tables 
   - /etc/mtab should be read upon SIGHUP signal
 - sytem interfaces
   - vfsmount
 - shutdown testing
 - errors, failures
