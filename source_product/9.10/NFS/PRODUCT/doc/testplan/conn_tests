.H 1 "Connectivity (Dan Simula)"

This section of the system test plan addresses the connectivity requirements 
of the NFS product.  The specific connectivity requirements are 
described in the NFS Product Requirements Document [1].

NFS connectivity is defined as "the fully functional, reliable exchange 
of data, commands, control information and results between an NFS client 
process and an NFS server process."  The client and server processes may 
reside separately on one of many multi-vendor NFS systems and must operate 
reliably regardless of system loads, network loads, or relative performance 
differences.  NFS connectivity addresses all functional aspects of the
NFS product including remote file system operations, the YP services, the 
PC-NFS daemon, and associated NFS/RPC user commands.

In order to demonstrate NFS connectivity, a connectivity test suite will
be run bi-directionally between a Model 9K system and a selected target system.
The connectivity test suite will consist of functional tests for commands
(section 1 of the HP-UX manual), system calls (section 2), libraries (section
3), and the mount/umount commands (section 1M).  The tests will be
run for an extended period of time (i.e., 24 hours nonstop), and will be
be highly leveraged from the following groups of tests;

.nf
		o the RFA-NFS functional tests,
		o the Sun NFS connectivity test suite,
		o the SSO HP-UX/Diskless test suite,
		o the s300/800 file system tests, and
		o NFS functional tests developed by 
		  the Nerfs project group.
.fi


If test cases exist that are not addressed by the leveraged tests, 
original tests will be designed and written to address those test cases.

The connectivity test suite will reside in the NFS scaffold and will rely 
on the scaffold environment for its execution environment.  In the event 
that a target system cannot support the NFS scaffold (e.g., VAX/VMS 
systems, Vectra (PC)), manual methods will be employed to execute an
equivalent battery of tests.

Each of the following sub-sections addresses a specific multi-vendor
NFS system.  In the event that the target system only supports client
capabilities or server capabilities, the connectivity test suite will
only be exercised uni-directionally.

.H 2  "Sun systems"

Sun Micro Systems, Inc. has set the industry standard for network file
systems.  The NFS product must be tested against the two latest
major releases of Sun's NFS product ([1] section 1.4.1).  Since Sun 
systems define the standard, Sun connectivity testing will be done 
first.  Once connectivity is verified to the Sun systems, the other 
multi-vendor implementations will be tested.

To test basic connectivity, the test suite will be run between comparable 
systems (i.e., comparable SPU performance, disk capacity and performance,
and system load). An example of comparable systems would be an HP330 w/7945
and a SUN3/160.  In order to establish basic connectivity, the connectivity
test suite must be run bi-directionally between the two systems for a period
of 24 hours without error.  Once basic connectivity is established between 
comparable systems, systems with dissimilar performance capabilities will 
be tested against one another (e.g., s310 vs Sun3/260 and s350 vs Sun2/150).  
Since basic connectivity has already been established, the connectivity 
test suite will be run for only 12 hours between the dissimilar systems to 
verify full connectivity.

.H 2  "HP Vectra"

NFS capabilities are provided for the HP Vectra (PC) system by Sun's PC-NFS
product.  This product provides client-only capabilities.  To establish 
NFS connectivity between the HP Vectra and the Model 9000 NFS systems, tests
equivalent to those in the connectivity test suite will be run from
the Vectra to a Model 9000 target system.  Since the Vectra cannot support
the NFS scaffold environment, equivalent tests will have to be designed,
coded and tested by the individual responsible for testing connectivity
to the Vectra.  If possible, test suites which currently exist for the
PC will be used to expedite the process.
