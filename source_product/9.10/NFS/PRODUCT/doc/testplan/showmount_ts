.H 2 "showmount Test Plan"

This chapter covers the
.B showmount
command.  The main use of this command is to list information about the
file systems mounted on the local host, or other hosts on the network.
It provides much the same functionality as the
.B mount
command.  The main distinction is that
.B mount
only looks on the local host, and is unable to display remote host mount
table information.

Test
.B showmount
with no options.
It should show the mounted file systems for the local host.

Test
.B showmount
with any option besides "-a", "-d" or "-e".
It should print the usage error message on stderr
and exit with a non-zero status.
Test with more than one host name.
It should print the usage error message on stderr
and exit with a non-zero status.
Note: this test should not attempt to use the "-d" option, since this is
often used as an undocumented "debug" option.
Run 
.B showmount
with two host names.
Run 
.B showmount
when portmap is not running.

IMPLEMENT TIME:  0.75 md
PERFORM TIME:    1.75 md
TYPE OF TEST:    functional
EXPECTED OUTPUT: no output if the test passes
.fi
.sp 1
Test
.B showmount
with all combinations of the valid options listed above.
Test with the local host, and then a remote host.
In all cases it should show information about the exported file systems.
It would be appropriate to verify this information by using the local
.B mount
command, either directly or via
.B remsh
on the remote host.  This is to verify that
.B showmount
is telling the truth about the mounted file systems.
