.H 1 "Cross-Services Tests (Jim Hunter)"
.sp 1
.H 2 "NFS/RFA Cross-Services Discussion (Jim Hunter)"
.H 3 "Introduction"
.sp 1
The objective of the NFS/RFA cross services tests is to isolate defects
peculiar to NFS and RFA interactions which would not be found through other 
testing processes.
.sp 2
.H 3 "Scope of the tests"
.sp 1
The success or failure of the tests will be determined using the following
criteria outlined below and if appropriate, an analysis of the end state
of the system.
.sp 1
.BL
.LI
The system should not crash or hang.
.LI
The integrity of both services should be preserved.
.LE
.sp 2
.H 3 "Implementation Goals"
.sp 1
.BL
In order to implement the model outlined above, the following are identified
as desirable goals:
.LI
Ability to measure results and detect failures.
.LI
Flexibility to integrate with the scaffold.
.LE

.H 2 "RFA -> NFS"

The time estimates to perform the following tests are based on executing the
test once.
.sp 1
.nf
RESPONSIBLE ENGINEER: Paul Van Farowe
DEPENDENCY: Server changes to RFA have been made and tested.
ISSUE: Will the RFA changes be allowed in the real code.

This configuration will not be supported due to an RFA path-parsing limitation.
The problem lies somewhere in the parsing of the RFA connection path.  However,
any attempt to use this configuration should produce an appropriate error
message.

.H 3 "RFA NOT inherited by nfsd"
.sp 1
Create the RFA connection AFTER the NFS daemons have been started so that
the NFS daemons do NOT inherit the RFA connection.  Attempt to 'cd' to or
'ls' /mnt/net/C/*  and verify that an appropriate error message is returned.

Note that this test need only be executed a two or three times
before release to verify the proper behavior.

.sp 1
Create a RFA connection from node A to node B.  Then attempt to mount node
C's file system onto a mount point on node B through RFA.  The mount command
should not be able to handle the network special file and the mount will
fail with a networking error.
