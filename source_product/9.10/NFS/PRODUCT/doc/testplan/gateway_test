.H 1 "Topology/Gateway Testing (Steve Booth)"

HP's series 9K NFS code will be certified through 2 gateways
and a bridge: a SUN workstation, a series 9K workstation, and
the McBridge (bridge) box from Roseville Networks Division (RND).
NFS operation through a gateway/bridge will be fully
certified only after testing fails to find defects in the code.

.DS
ASSUMPTIONS: YP tests exist in a separate subdirectory under
               the nfs subdirectory; defects associated with
               a local (same LAN) YP server have been found
               and fixed.
             The 'ypset' command will be available to execute
               the YP functional tests through a gateway.
             The 9K gateway code has previously been tested
               and certified w/out NFS interactions

               configurations:

.DE

Gateway/bridge testing will consist of running the quick regression,
functional, and stress tests between two nodes communicating through
a gateway/bridge.  The two nodes will not necessarily be on different
physical LAN cables.

A list of any defects found in HP's competitors' code will be maintained
and given to marketing at the end of the project.

.H 2  "SUN Gateway Tests"

RESPONSIBLE ENGINEER: Jason Zions

Since the majority of LAN gateways (in the NFS marketplace) are SUN
workstations, the majority of gateway testing will be with the SUN.

.sp 2
.H 3 "quick regression"
.sp 1

Run continuous 12-hour repetitions of the quick regression tests until
they fail to isolate defects.

.H 2  "9K Gateway Tests"

.DS
RESPONSIBLE ENGINEER: Steve Booth
ASSUMPTIONS:  SUN gateway testing already in progress; most
                gateway-related defects already isolated and
                fixed
              9K gateway code already tested w/out NFS
.DE

The intent is to isolate NFS defects, NOT 9K gateway defects.

.sp 2
.H 3 "functional and stress tests"
.sp 1

Run the functional and stress tests overnight
until all defects (found by the testing) are resolved.

                and fixed
              McBridge box already tested and working

It is anticipated that NFS testing via McBridge will be done
in late April.
