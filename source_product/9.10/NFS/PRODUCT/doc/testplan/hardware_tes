.H 1 "Hardware Testing (Steve Booth)"

.H 2 "Series 3x0 machines"

Hardware testing for the Series s300 machines will focus on 2 areas:
amount of RAM in the machine, and speed of the system disc or other
mounted (and exported) mass storage device.  Standard configurations
for memory and disc device will be tested throughout the quality
assurance (QA) period,
and will not be specifically included in this chapter.

The goal of this testing is to find defects which would not be found
by testing "standard" configurations.



The configurations found in the matrix that follows will be used in
conjunction with the stress tests (defined in the chapter entitled "Stress")
and will be executed overnight until all defects found by the tests have
been fixed.

2M  = suggested minimum RAM to be used on the 310/320 during testing
4M  = suggested minimum RAM to be used on the 330 during testing
8M  = suggested minimum RAM to be used on the 350 during testing
4M  = suggested maximum RAM to be used on the 310/320 during testing
6M  = suggested maximum RAM to be used on the 330 during testing
10M = suggested maximum RAM to be used on the 350 during testing

    9122  |  4M      2M      6M      8M

The 9122 is considered one of HP's slower discs,
while the 7935 and 7937 are considered fast discs.

Each machine in the above matrix has two configurations, one each with
a "large" and "small" amount of memory.  For example, the series 310's
small configuration uses 2Mbytes of memory and a 7935 or 7937 disc, and
its large configuration uses 4Mbytes of memory and a 9122 disc.  These
configurations are used in the test matrix below.

The configurations shown in the test matrix should be sufficient to
find the defects relating to NFS/YP-RAM/DISC interactions.

The LINUS and BUFFALO tape drives are CS80 devices, and could be
mounted and used as extremely slow mass storage devices.  The scenario
is considered bizarre enough not to warrant testing.

RESPONSIBLE ENGINEERS: Steve Booth, Jeff Elison
ASSUMPTIONS :   defects found by early invocations of the stress tests 
                have been found and fixed; the code is somewhat stable
DEPENDENCIES:   availability of 9122, 7935, and 7937 disc drives
ISSUES:         the PHOENIX card (MS-DOS card) is capable of accessing
                the HPUX file system, and so can use NFS; the issue is
                where responsibility lies for testing PHOENIX with NFS,

.H 2 "Series 8x0 machines"

Hardware testing for the Series s800 machines will focus on 2 areas:
amount of RAM in the machine, and performance level of the system.
The objective of this testing is to verify connectivity between
HP machines of differing performance levels and memory capacity
for the HP-UX networking product under test.

Amount of RAM will be varied from the minimum to the maximun 
configuration for each system.  


The various possible configurations will be used in conjunction
with the stress tests (defined in the chapter entitled "Stress")
and will be executed overnight until all defects found by the tests
have been fixed.
