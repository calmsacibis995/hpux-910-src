.H 1 "Tests with long filenames ( >14 characters ) (Steve Booth)"

NFS compabilility requires that HP machines support filenames
with more than the traditional maximum of 14 characters, at least
across NFS boundaries.

The Series 300, under a proposal current as of 5/28/87, will support
longer filenames ONLY across NFS boundaries, and will enforce the
14-character limit locally.  UFS (local) filenames will be truncated
to a maximum of 14 characters, while NFS filenames will be passed to
the remote NFS server untouched (maximum of 255 characters).  For
example, an HP NFS server node will truncate all files it creates on
the local HP system to a maximum of 14 characters.

Series 800 machines, as of 5/28/87, will support long filenames
locally.

.H 2 "Testing Methodology" 

A sampling of the existing functional tests will be copied into
a separate subdirectory under the "nfs" directory, and will be modified
to use long filenames.

The tests that will be copied/modified are:
    rm, touch, mkdir
    creat, link, open
    rename, symlink (symbolic link tests)

Behavioral differences will be expected when these tests are run from
SUN->HP, HP->HP, and HP->SUN.
