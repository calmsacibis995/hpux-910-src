* NFS Services/300 *
********************

	The following information describes the major changes to the NFS
	Services/300 product since the 6.2 release.

NFS 3.2 features
----------------

	With HP-UX 6.5, the NFS 3.2 features are now supported.  The
	major features in NFS 3.2 are remote file locking, rpcgen, rex,
	and NFS support for named pipes and device files.  These are
	discussed in more detail below.

Remote File Locking
-------------------

	The Lock Manager (rpc.lockd) and Status Monitor (rpc.statd)
	provide System V compatible file and record locking (fcntl(2)
	and lockf(2) calls) for NFS files.  Only advisory locks are
	supported for NFS files.

	File locking requests go to the local node's rpc.lockd first.
	It then checks with the local statd, and then calls the remote
	lockd to service the request.  The local lock request will block
	and cannot be killed until a response is received from the remote
	rpc.lockd.

RPCGEN
------

	RPCGEN is a tool that takes high level (C-like) descriptions of
	server and client programs and produces skeleton programs.
	These programs have the appropriate rpc calls inserted to allow
	the two programs to exist on separate machines and use rpc to
	communicate with each other.  The skeleton programs have stub
	functions which call the user-supplied server and client
	functions that do the actual processing.  RPCGEN was created to
	take the tediousness out of remote procedure programming.

REX - Remote Execution Service
------------------------------

	The Remote Execution Service, REX, is similar to remsh(1) in
	that it allows execution of processes on remote machines.
	However, it is based on RPC instead of just TCP.  Also, it adds
	the following features beyond remsh(1):

	a)  Capability   to  handle  interactive   processes,  including
	    propagation  of  the  current  terminal/tty driver  settings,
	    such as interrupt character, etc.
	b)  Determination of the current  directory,  and the ability to
	    NFS mount that  directory from the machine acting as the REX
	    server.
	c)  Passing  of  ALL environment  variables  from  the currently
	    executing process.
	d)  Propagation of the current window size.
	e)  Propagation of the interrupt signal to the remote process.

Named Pipes and Device Files
----------------------------

	Access to named pipes and device files is now supported with
	NFS.  All access is relative to the client, so only processes on
	the same NFS client will be able to communicate using a named
	pipe with NFS, and device files are interpretted to mean a
	device attached to the client system.

RPC and XDR
-----------

	RPC is now updated to be compatible with the Sun 3.9 version.

NFS Defect fixes
----------------

	The 6.5 release of NFS contains fixes for several defects,
	including:

	+  Fixes for "freeing free inode" panic that could occur after
	   an fsck on reboot.

	+  Fixes for a potential data corruption when using O_APPEND
	   with NFS.

	+  moved the umount/mount of nfs file systems to a new file
	   called /etc/netnfsrc2 in order to be done after starting
	   inetd.  This allows nfs loopback mounts from /etc/rc (at
	   bootup).
