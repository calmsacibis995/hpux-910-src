# This file defines network wide groups used for permission
# checking when doing remote mounts, remote logins, and remote
# shells. 
#
# The format for each entry is:
# groupname  member1  member2 ...
#
# where each member is either another network group name, or a triplet:
#
#	(hostname, username, domainname)
#
# For example:
#
# engineering	hardware software (host3, mikey, hp)
# hardware	(hardwhost1, chm, hp)   (hardwhost2, dae, hp)
# software	(softwhost1, jad, hp)   (softwhost2, dds, hp)
