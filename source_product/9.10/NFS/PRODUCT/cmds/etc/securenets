# /etc/securenets file
#
# The format of this file is one of more lines of
#
# netmask netaddr
# Both netmask and netaddr must be dotted quads.  The netmask is not
# generally the same as the netmask set in /etc/netlinkrc.  It can
# be used to restrict valid system address to be in certain subnets.
# A netmask of 255.255.255.255 will work with any system IP address.
# A netmask of 255.255.255.0 followed by a subnet address with '0'
# in the last position will allow access from any address in that subnet.
#
# Note that for a machine with two Ethernet interfaces (i.e. a gateway
# machine), the IP addresses of both have to be in /etc/securenets.
#
# Examples:
# The entry: 
#	255.255.255.0 128.185.124.00
# allows access to all hosts in the 128.185.124 subnet
# 
# The entry:
#	255.255.255.255 15.13.104.138
# allows access only to the host with IP address 15.13.104.138.
#
# Sample entries:
#255.255.255.255	15.1.42.95
#255.255.255.0		15.1.128.0
